All staff members are employed at will as defined by California Law. Neither this handbook nor any other personnel document or oral statement, including benefit plan descriptions, constitutes an employment contract or creates any type of contractual obligation or promise or representation of continued employment for any staff employee. Neither the employee nor the Institute is bound to continue the employment relationship if either, at any time, chooses to end it. </p><p>The Institute reserves the right to change, revise, or eliminate any of the policies described herein, except for the policy of at will employment for staff members. The only recognized deviations from stated policies are those that are in writing, authorized and signed by the president of the College. </p><p>Some of the policies and provisions contained herein (such as holiday and CTO benefits) are not applicable to faculty. If you have any questions as to which policies are not applicable to faculty, please address them to the Human Resources Department. Additional policies and provisions that apply solely to the faculty are described in a Faculty Handbook section of the Institute Handbook. </p><p>While the Employee Handbook provides much detail, it does not cover every permutation of every situation. Questions should be directed to the Human Resources Office at ext. 3520. The College President is the final and binding interpreter of the provisions of the Employee Handbook as they apply to the facts of a particular situation. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.b.</span></strong> <strong><span>About the Institute</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey is an academic community committed to preparing innovative professionals able to provide leadership in cross-cultural, multilingual environments. Founded in 1955 with a commitment to promoting international understanding through the study of language and culture, the Institute has graduated prominent leaders in foreign service and diplomacy, in language teaching, translation and interpretation, and in the international business and nonprofit communities. </p><p>Effective June 30, 2010, the Institute merged with Middlebury College following an affiliation with the College that was established in 2005. One of the country’s leading liberal arts colleges, Middlebury is also home to the renowned Middlebury Language Schools, Schools Abroad in twelve countries, the Bread Loaf School of English, and the Bread Loaf Writer’s Conference. Affiliation with Middlebury has created a unique opportunity for both institutions to have an even greater impact in the realm of global education. </p><p>As a graduate school of Middlebury College, the Institute is governed by the Board of Trustees of Middlebury College, which has also established a Board of Overseers of the Institute to review and advise the Institute regarding its operations and to make recommendations to the Board of Trustees of the College. </p><p>The Institute is organized into two graduate schools that offer professional master’s degrees from its Monterey, California campus:</p><p>• The Graduate School of International Policy and Management</p><p>• The Graduate School of Translation, Interpretation, and Language Education </p><p>The Institute is also home to the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, the world’s largest nongovernmental organization devoted to curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and to a number of non-degree programs including intensive and customized language learning opportunities.</p><p><strong><span>D.1.c.</span></strong> <strong><span>Diversity</span></strong> </p><p>At the Institute, our international focus reinforces our emphasis on diversity in our student body and in our faculty and staff. The Institute recognizes the importance of treating every member of the community with fairness and respect and encourages inter-cultural understanding in all our dealings with each other, just as we embed cross-cultural competence in all our academic programs. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.d.</span></strong> <strong><span>Non-discrimination, Anti-Harassment and Related Policies</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, as a Graduate School of Middlebury College, falls under the jurisdiction of Middlebury College policy with regard to compliance with any and all federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination.  Please see the Middlebury <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies">Non-Discrimination Policies</a>, which include the Middlebury <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/anti-harassment-discrimin">Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy</a>,  and the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/smdvs">Policy Against Sexual Misconduct, Domestic and Dating Violence and Misconduct, and Stalking</a>. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.e.</span></strong> <strong><span>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span></strong> </p><p>The Institute recognizes and supports the standards set forth in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California laws that are designed to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The Institute does not discriminate against individuals with disabilities in any aspect of the employment relationship, and provides reasonable accommodations as required by law to otherwise qualified employees and applicants with disabilities except for undue hardship situations. Employment and educational opportunities or privileges will not be denied to an otherwise qualified employee or applicant because of the need for reasonable accommodation of the individual's disability. Discrimination based on an employee's or applicant's association with a disabled individual is also forbidden. Employees with disability-related concerns should contact the Human Resources Office to initiate the process of requesting an accommodation or to present a complaint of violation of this policy. </p><p>The Institute will make reasonable accommodations as required by law. Qualifying disabilities can include, for example, vision, hearing, or mobility impairments, psychological and medical conditions, and learning disabilities that limit one or more of an employee’s major life activities and may necessitate non-essential modifications to the facilities or the job, but which do not prevent the employee from effectively performing, with reasonable accommodations, the essential functions of the job. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.f.</span></strong> <strong><span>Employment Eligibility</span></strong> </p><p>It is the policy of the Institute to employ only United States citizens and aliens who are authorized to work in the United States. In complying with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, it is against Institute policy to discriminate because of an individual's national origin, citizenship, or intent to become a U.S. citizen. In accordance with federal law, each prospective employee shall be required to provide, within 72 hours of employment, documents verifying her/his identity and authorization to be legally employed in the United States. In addition, the prospective employee will be required to sign a verification attesting s/he is legally employable in the United States. The Institute shall retain copies of the documents submitted by the employee. To the extent practical and appropriate, these documents will be kept confidential. However, the Institute is required to provide copies of the documents to the U.S. Department of Labor and the Customs and Immigration Service ("USCIS", formerly “INS”) on request. </p><p>Providing false documentation or making false statements on the verification shall be grounds for immediate termination. During the course of employment, if the Institute requests further information relating to the employee's authorization to work in the United States, the employee shall furnish the information requested. Failure to cooperate in furnishing such information shall be grounds for discipline, up to and including termination.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.g.</span></strong> <strong><span>Affirmative Action</span></strong> </p><p>Middlebury College and the Middlebury Institute maintain Affirmative Action Plans, and commit themselves to good faith and lawful efforts to correct any under-representation or under-utilization that has been identified by the Institute as warranting such action. The Manager of Human Resources has been designated the Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Officer for the Institute. Inquiries concerning the application of federal and state laws and regulations should be referred to the Human Resources Office.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.h.</span></strong> <strong><span>Identification Cards</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>All employees are expected to obtain an Institute photo identification card within the first week of employment. After submitting the required employment paperwork to the Human Resources Office, new employees may make arrangements to obtain identification cards by contacting Security at x4153. Identification cards are property of the Institute and must be relinquished at the conclusion of employment. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.i.</span></strong> <strong><span>Background Screenings</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>The Institute requires that all newly hired employees have a background screening, and in some cases a credit check, performed by a third party specialist organization. </p><p>Credit checks are conducted for positions in the Business Office, the Institutional Advancement Office and other positions with fiduciary duties or responsibilities, or with significant access to related information. </p><p>Any offer of employment made prior to the completion of the background check is conditional, contingent upon receipt of information satisfactory to the Institute.  </p><p>All pre-employment background screenings are conducted by a third party to ensure privacy. Screenings are conducted in conformity with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and state and federal anti-discrimination and privacy laws. All screening reports are maintained separately from employee personnel files. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), all background screenings are done only after a person has received a disclosure and has signed a release. </p><p>An individual who has previously been employed at the Institute and is returning to work after being absent for more than one year will be required to undergo a background screening. </p><p>An employee who transfers or is promoted to a position that has fiduciary responsibilities will be required to consent to a background screening. </p><p>These screenings will only be performed with the candidate’s permission and only if the Institute intends to offer a candidate employment. If a candidate declines to give permission to conduct these screenings, s/he will not be eligible for employment at the Institute.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.j.</span></strong> <strong><span>New Employee Orientation</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Orientation sessions are hosted by Human Resources and are designed to introduce new staff members to the history, culture, and mission of the Institute, as well as allow them to complete required employment paperwork. The orientation program provides employees with the opportunity to meet different members of the community, become acquainted with the campus, review Institute policies, and enroll in eligible benefit programs. </p><p>Each newly hired regular staff employee receives a job description and a letter of appointment summarizing the terms of employment, compensation rate, number of work hours per week, payment schedule, whether the employee is overtime exempt, whether the employee is eligible for benefits, and the name of the employee’s supervisor. </p><p>New employees also receive orientation within their departments, covering safety procedures for the particular location and other matters pertinent to the position. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.k.</span></strong> <strong><span>Introductory Period for New Employees</span></strong> </p><p>All new or rehired employees work on a provisional basis for the first three months. Employees are encouraged to take advantage of this period to determine whether the position meets their expectations and to get clarification concerning responsibilities. The Institute will use this period to evaluate an employee's capabilities and work habits. Either the Institute or the employee may end the employment relationship at will, with or without cause, during the introductory period or thereafter. </p><p>Provisional employment status does not affect eligibility for employer-provided benefits.</p><p>A newly hired employee will receive a performance appraisal at the completion of the provisional period. Subsequent reviews occur annually on a schedule published by the Human Resources Office.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.l.</span></strong> <strong><span>Personnel Records</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Disclosure of personnel files is restricted to authorized persons within the Institute. Any request regarding personnel files should be directed to Human Resources staff, who are the only people authorized to release information about current or former employees. Disclosure of confidential personnel information to outside sources is limited. The Institute generally will release personnel information to third parties if the employee has given her/his written authorization or if release of the records is needed to protect or advance the Institute's business interests or otherwise is lawful. The Institute will provide information as requested by authorized law enforcement or local, state, or federal agencies conducting official investigations and as otherwise legally required. </p><p>Employees are responsible for ensuring that their names, addresses and information about dependents or marital status are kept up to date in their personnel files. To ensure continuity of benefits, Human Resources should be informed immediately of any such changes. The Institute is required by law to maintain current employee records and for official purposes can rely only on existing records; the Institute is not responsible for accommodating any status change not communicated in writing (including via email) to the Human Resources Office. </p><p>Personal directory information about Institute employees (home address, phone number) is maintained for the purpose of facilitating essential communication and is disseminated only to those members of the Institute administration who have a need to know. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.m.</span></strong> <strong><span>Personnel File Access Policy</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Employees have the legal right to inspect certain documents in their personnel files. Such inspections must occur in the presence of a Human Resources representative at a mutually convenient time.<em> </em></p><p>Employees may inspect or receive a copy of the personnel records that the Institute maintains relating to your performance or to any grievance concerning you. Certain documents may be excluded or redacted from your personnel file by law, and there are legal limitations on the number of requests that can be made. </p><p>Any request to inspect or copy personnel records must be made in writing to the Human Resources Manager. You may designate a representative to conduct the inspection of the record or receive a copy of the records. However, any designated representative must be authorized by you in writing to inspect or receive a copy of the records. The Institute may take reasonable steps to verify the identity of any representative you have designated in writing to inspect or receive a copy of your personnel records.</p><p>The personnel records may be made available to you either at 437 Pierce Street, Monterey, CA or at a mutually agreeable location (with no loss of compensation for going to that location to inspect or copy the records). The records will be made available no later than 30 calendar days from the date the Institute receives your written request to inspect or copy your personnel records (unless you/your representative and the Institute mutually agree in writing to a date beyond 30 calendar days but no later than 35 calendar days from receipt of the written request). </p><p>Disclosure of personnel information to outside sources, other than your designated representative, will be limited. However, the Institute will cooperate with requests from authorized law enforcement or local, state, or federal agencies conducting official investigations and as otherwise legally required. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.n.</span></strong> <strong><span>Reporting Time &amp; Payroll Issues</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>All employees of the Institute are paid every other Friday on a bi-weekly pay period basis. If a payday falls on a holiday, employees will receive paychecks on the last working day of the week. The pay period begins on Monday and ends on the following second Sunday. The pay calendar can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/offices-services/human-resources/employee-resources">Employee Resources</a> section of the Institute’s website.</p><p>Hourly and salaried staff are required to use the <a href="https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin">BannerWeb</a> system to record hours worked and leave taken during each pay period. All time must be submitted by 3:00 PM on the Friday prior to the close of the pay period in order to be included in the next paycheck. Failure to submit time by the prescribed deadline may result in disciplinary action. Time reporting procedures for exempt staff are not for the purposes of evaluating the amount or quality of work performed nor for pay purposes, and do not alter the fact that exempt staff are not paid based on the number of hours worked. </p><p>If you feel your check may be inaccurate, first verify that your time was submitted accurately and on time. Issues regarding rate of pay, positions or titles and time off should be directed to Human Resources. Other paycheck issues, such as those involving taxes, should be directed to the Payroll department.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.o.</span></strong> <strong><span>Employment Status</span></strong><em> </em></p><p><span>The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey maintains the following staff employment status definitions. These definitions are used primarily to determine eligibility for benefits. The primary basis for determining employment status is committed hours, defined as regularly scheduled and budgeted hours assigned to a specific position. Regardless of the number of hours actually worked, on-call positions have no committed hours. Human Resources will work collaboratively with managers to determine the classification of each position.</span> </p><p><strong><em>Regular staff employees</em></strong> work on a regular schedule for an unspecified duration and are normally employed for a position as a result of open recruitment. Regular employees may be classified as full-time; part-time benefit eligible; part-time non-benefit eligible.<strong><em> </em></strong>  </p><p>If a regular staff employee is classified as exempt, the employee is not paid based on the number of hours worked. If a regular staff employee is classified as non-exempt, the employee is paid based on the number of hours worked AND AN HOURLY RATE OF PAY. </p><p><strong><em>Full-time staff employees </em></strong>are normally scheduled to work 37.5 hours per week. To be classified as full-time for purposes of benefits, an employee must be scheduled to work at least 32 hours per week (1664 hours per year). Full-time staff employees are benefits eligible.<strong><em> </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Part-time, benefit eligible staff employees</em></strong> are scheduled to work at least 20 but less than 32 hours per week (between 1000 and 1663 hours per year). </p><p><strong><em>Part-time, non-benefit eligible staff employees</em></strong> are scheduled to work less than 20 hours per week, or less than 1000 hours per year. </p><p><strong><em>Time-limited employees </em></strong>are employed for an assignment of a “not to exceed” specific duration. A time-limited employee is eligible for benefits if the committed hours for his/her position totals 1000 hours in the 12 months following his/her appointment. Postgraduate Fellows are included in this category. Time-limited assignments may be extended; however, the employment status of an employee who works longer than the period originally expected and designated will not automatically change. </p><p><strong><em>On-call staff employees</em></strong> work as needed on an hourly basis. Hours may vary from part-time to full-time. There are no committed hours attached to these positions. On-call staff are not eligible for benefits. </p><p>Staff positions funded from external sources will be classified into the appropriate job status as determined by job assignment and the duration of time that the position is not to exceed. </p><p>All staff employment, regardless of employment status definition, is at-will, at the mutual consent of the employee and the Institute. (See At-Will Employment, below.) </p><p>Part-time and time-limited employees may be ineligible for Institute Benefits. To determine eligibility for specific benefits consult the sections of this handbook addressing those benefits or, if applicable, the Summary Plan Descriptions. </p><p>Independent contractors and consultants are not employees of the Institute and are not entitled to employee benefits. Terms and conditions of their services are set forth in an agreement entered into between the Institute and the contractor. </p><p>If you have any doubt about your status as described above, contact the Manager of Human Resources. </p><p>The Institute reserves the right, at any time, to alter or change job responsibilities, reassign or transfer job positions, or assign additional job responsibilities. From time to time, employees may be asked to work on special projects or to perform other work necessary or important to the operation of the department or the Institute. Cooperation and assistance in performing such additional work is expected. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.p.</span></strong> <strong><span>At-Will Employment</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>The administration of The Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey hopes that every staff employee will find the employment relationship with the Institute satisfying and rewarding in all respects. At the same time, it recognizes that employment relationships are not always mutually satisfactory. To protect the rights of both staff employee and the Institute, employees should remember that employment is at the mutual consent of the employee and the Institute. As defined by the <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;division=3.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=2.&amp;article=4.">California Labor Code</a>, either the at-will employee or the Institute can terminate the employment relationship, at any time, with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. Staff members who work in positions with a pre-scheduled not to exceed end date, whether funded by grant or contract monies or otherwise known as a “fixed term” position are in at-will status during that time and subject to conclusion of employment at or before the scheduled end date. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.q.</span></strong> <strong><span>Work Schedule</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>The Institute normally is open for business between the hours of 8:30 AM and 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. Some departments, such as the library, are open extended hours. Supervisors are responsible for assigning individual work schedules. Employees are expected to be at their desks or work stations at the start of their scheduled hours, ready to perform their work. The workday (a consecutive 24-hour period) begins at 12:01 AM and ends at midnight. The workweek begins on Monday and ends on Sunday.<strong><br /></strong></p><p></p><p><strong><span>D.1.r.</span></strong> <strong><span>Telecommuting</span></strong> </p><p>The Institute places a high value on community and quality of service to its students. Generally, this means that faculty and staff need to perform their work on campus with their students and colleagues.  We do recognize, however, that there may be circumstances in which an employee is unable to be present on campus, but could work effectively from another location.  An employee who would like to explore this possibility should first speak with his/her supervisor, who will ascertain whether or not telecommuting is feasible, and if so, work with HR to develop a telecommuting agreement that ensures compliance with relevant state and federal regulations.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.s.</span></strong>  <strong>E</strong><strong><span>xempt/Non-Exempt Status</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Under state and federal laws regarding overtime pay, the Institute’s executive, administrative and support staff members are classified either overtime exempt or non-exempt. Exempt employees are paid a salary that covers all work and do not receive additional compensation for hours worked beyond their normal workweek. Determination of exempt or non-exempt status is made by Human Resources, based on the employee’s job description, state and federal law, and guidelines issued by the California Industrial Welfare Commission and U.S. Department of Labor. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.t.</span></strong> <strong><span>Compensatory Time Off</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Employees who are non-exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act or the California Labor Code are not granted compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. All hours worked in excess of the employee’s normal workweek will be compensated as extra pay and should be recorded and submitted in the current pay period. </p><p>Exempt employees are paid a fixed salary intended to provide all of the compensation to which they are entitled. They are not entitled to additional compensation for extra hours of work or time off in lieu of additional compensation. Neither extra compensation nor compensatory time off will be owed or payable to an exempt employee upon separation from the Institute for any reason. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.u.</span></strong> <strong><span>Meal and Rest Periods</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Non-exempt employees working shifts lasting five hours or longer are entitled to a one-hour, unpaid meal period taken approximately in the middle of the work shift. Non-exempt employees working more than six-hour shifts may not “skip” the meal period to shorten the workday. If an employee is not provided a meal break, they will be paid one additional hour of pay at their regular pay rate. They are allowed paid ten-minute rest periods for every four hours of work or major portion thereof. Rest periods should be taken approximately halfway through the four-hour period. Rest periods cannot be combined or saved to create extended meal breaks, leave early, or arrive late. When necessary, supervisors are responsible for scheduling meal and rest periods. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.v.</span></strong> <strong><span>Voting (time off)</span></strong> </p><p>In accordance with California Elections Code section 14000, employees who do not have sufficient time outside of working hours to vote at a statewide election may take off enough working time that — when added to the voting time available outside of working hours — will enable them to vote. The Institute will provide the employee up to two hours of time off with pay to vote. The time off for voting will be only at the beginning or end of the regular work shift, whichever allows the most free time for voting and the least time off from the regular working shifts, unless otherwise mutually agreed. </p><p>If by the third working day prior to the day of election employees know, or have reason to believe, that time off will be necessary to be able to vote on election day, they must give their supervisor at least two working days' notice that time off for voting is desired, in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p><strong><span>D.1.w.</span></strong> <strong><span>Call-In Pay (Reporting-Time Pay)</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>In accordance with the State of California's Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Order 4-2001, the Institute will pay a minimum of two hours pay to non-exempt employees who are required to report to work on a day other than their normally scheduled workday. In addition, the Institute will pay non-exempt employees for half of the regularly scheduled workday if employees report to work as instructed and there is not work available, except if the interruption of work is because of the failure of any or all public utilities, or because of an act of God or other cause not within the Institute's power to control.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.x.</span></strong> <strong><span>Garnishment of Wages</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>The Institute is obligated to comply with all wage garnishment orders. Questions regarding wage garnishment should be directed to Human Resources. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.y.</span></strong> <strong><span>Overtime</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Employees occasionally may be required to work extra hours. Exempt employees may be expected to work beyond their normal schedules, as their job responsibilities require, and do so without additional pay beyond their regular salary. Non-exempt employees receive additional compensation at the rate of time and one-half, for hours worked in addition to 8 hours per workday and/or 40 hours per workweek, up to 12 hours worked and thereafter at double time. For purposes of determining which hours constitute additional time, only actual hours worked in a given work week will be counted;  sick leave taken, jury duty leave, or call-in/reporting time payment do not count towards hours worked. Failure to obtain one’s supervisor’s approval before working overtime may result in disciplinary action. </p><p>A workday begins at 12:01 AM and ends 24 hours later. A workweek begins each Monday at 12:01 AM. </p><p>All regular time and overtime hours must be accurately recorded on the non-exempt employee's timesheet and approved by the supervisor prior to payment. Tampering, altering, or falsifying time records will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.z.</span></strong> <strong><span>Travel Pay</span></strong> </p><p>Exempt employees are not paid on the basis of hours worked, and there is therefore no additional pay or compensatory time for time spent traveling. </p><p>Employees are reimbursed for all out-of-pocket travel expenses allowable under the Institute’s travel guidelines. </p><p>For non-exempt employees, travel time (defined as time spent actively traveling between the normal work site and another location where work will be done) is considered work time and should be recorded as such on the time sheet. </p><p>Commuting time to and from the normal work place is not considered work time and is not compensated. If the employee departs from or returns to his/her home for work-related travel without first going to the normal work location, he/she should deduct the normal commute time from the travel time. </p><p>If the total number of hours worked (including travel) exceeds 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week, the employee is entitled to overtime pay calculated in accordance with the Institute's normal overtime policy. </p><p>Time spent during the course of travel on sleeping, eating meals, and other personal activities is not considered work time and is not compensated.</p><p><strong><span>D.1.aa.</span></strong> <strong><span>Pay Advances</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>The Institute does not provide pay advances. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.bb.</span></strong> <strong><span>Direct Deposits</span></strong> </p><p>Employees are eligible for automatic payroll deposit. They may initiate automatic deposit through the online <a href="https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin">Banner </a>system. Automatic deposit can be started or stopped at any time. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.cc.</span></strong> <strong><span>Payroll Records</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Employees may access their payroll records through the online <a href="https://ssb-prod.ec.middlebury.edu/PNTR/twbkwbis.P_WWWLogin">Banner </a>system.</p><p><strong><span>D.1.dd.</span></strong> <strong><span>Performance Evaluations</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Each staff employee is scheduled to receive periodic performance reviews. </p><p>The first review takes place after the initial three months of employment. Employees who transfer to another position within the Institute are reviewed with respect to their original job at the time of transfer, and within three months of assuming the new position. HR will notify the new supervisor when the three month review is due. Subsequent evaluations are normally conducted annually. The employee and the supervisor each complete a written evaluation of the employee’s job performance. They then share their evaluations with each other, and these documents form the basis for a discussion of the employee’s performance and professional development needs. The employee signs the evaluation to indicate that s/he has discussed it with her/his supervisor and is aware of its contents. The signed evaluation is placed in the employee’s personnel file. </p><p>Employees have the right to submit written responses to their evaluations, which will be added to their personnel files. Employee responses should be submitted within five working days of receiving their performance review. </p><p>Performance evaluations are intended to help employees recognize their progress, become aware of areas for improvement, and set objectives or goals for future work performance. Positive performance evaluations do not guarantee increases in salary, promotions, or continued employment. Salary increases and promotions are solely at the discretion of the Institute and depend upon many factors in addition to performance. </p><p>While professional development goals are an expected component of performance evaluations in general, a specific, written performance improvement plan is mandated if an employee receives an unacceptable overall rating on a performance evaluation, if the employee’s employment in that position is to continue thereafter.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.ee.</span></strong> <strong><span>Progressive Discipline</span></strong> </p><p>The Institute may choose in appropriate situations to utilize a progressive discipline system to serve as a fair and consistent means to enforce Institute rules and regulations and to address conduct or performance deficiencies. The purpose of progressive discipline is to retain employees through identification and correction of certain types of problems. Failure to correct such problems may lead to suspension or termination, and serious infractions may result in immediate termination. The Institute reserves the right to terminate the at-will employment of any employee at any time, with or without cause or notice; thus, progressive discipline is applicable or not, at the discretion of the Institute, for those situations deemed appropriate by the Institute. </p><p>If a situation, at the discretion of the Institute, warrants progressive discipline, the disciplinary actions applied may include a verbal warning, a written warning, a written reprimand, and/or termination from employment. Every action need not be taken in each case, and depending upon the relevant circumstances, the Institute may decide to take any disciplinary action, including immediate termination, at any time. Relevant circumstances that affect the course of disciplinary action may include the Institute’s judgment as to the seriousness or severity of the individual employee's deficiencies in performance and/or conduct, prior performance and conduct, and management's assessment of appropriate factors identified during the investigation. Examples of some of the circumstances that in the Institute’s judgment might lead to summary discharge include, but are not limited to: </p><ul><li>Conduct that is in opposition to the Institute's nondiscrimination or harassment policies;</li><li>Sustained insubordination or refusal to comply with a reasonable request given by the supervisor or Institute official, or abusive treatment of a supervisor or Institute official;</li><li>Theft of Institute property, personal property, or theft of service;</li><li>Falsification of records, time cards, or claiming sickness under false pretenses;</li><li>Disorderly conduct while on the job;</li><li>Deliberate, frequent, and/or recurring violations of stated safety regulations, even if they are not intentional;</li><li>Unexcused absence without notice for three days;</li><li>Use or possession of, or being under the influence of illegal substances or alcohol while at work;</li><li>Threatening physical harm, or actual physical violence to another member of the Institute community;</li><li>Breach of confidentiality, which is defined as releasing to unauthorized persons, or misuse of confidential information to which an employee is privy because of her/his job. </li></ul><p><strong><span>D.1.ff.</span></strong> <strong><span>Promotions and Transfers</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Employees are encouraged to apply for promotions to positions for which they are qualified. Promotions and transfer decisions are based on the hiring supervisor’s and/or his/her supervisor’s judgment of ability, qualifications, and potential for the position. Some promotions or transfers may be offered without open recruitment. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.gg.</span></strong> <strong><span>Employment: Internal Career Opportunities</span></strong> </p><p>All vacant positions are posted on the Institute web site for a minimum of 5 business days and internal candidates have an opportunity to apply unless in a special circumstance a waiver of posting is granted by the president of the College. </p><p>Normally, an employee must have been in her/his current position for a minimum of 3 months before being eligible to apply for positions in other departments. If an employee is selected to interview for a position, and is a final candidate, the employee should inform her/his current supervisor of her/his interest in the new position. If an employee is offered and accepts a position external to her/his current department, coordination between both departments, facilitated by Human Resources, may be required to ensure that the timing of such a transfer does not result in a hardship to the Institute. Normally, the transferring employee will assume her/his new duties two weeks after being selected for the new position. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.hh.</span></strong> <strong><span>Voluntary Termination of Employment/Resignation</span></strong> </p><p>Resignation is defined as employment termination initiated by an employee who chooses to leave the Institute. An employee who is considering leaving the Institute for any reason is encouraged to discuss her/his situation with her/his immediate supervisor before making a final decision. </p><p>If the employee chooses to leave the Institute, it is expected that as much notice as possible will be given in order to give the Institute the opportunity to plan for a smooth transition. At least two working weeks' notice is customary for non-exempt (hourly paid) employees while administrative and professional staff (salaried) are asked to give at least one month’s notice. A letter of resignation addressed to the department head, stating the final date(s) of employment, will be forwarded to Human Resources. Before leaving, the employee must visit the Human Resources Office to make benefit transition arrangements, to return all Institute property, and to have an exit interview with Human Resources.<em> </em></p><p>An employee who fails to report to work for three consecutively scheduled workdays without notice to, and approval by, her/his supervisor (or the Manager of Human Resources if the supervisor is not available) will be considered to have abandoned her/his job and will be considered to have resigned unless, in the sole judgment of the Institute, a true and reasonable excuse is thereafter offered and accepted by the Institute. </p><p>CTO time may not be taken in lieu of working the last two weeks of employment. The termination date is the actual last day of work. All unused accrued CTO hours will be paid on the employee’s last day of work. </p><p>All Institute-owned property (vehicles, keys, identification cards, parking permit, credit cards, laptop computers, uniforms, etc.) must be returned immediately upon termination of employment in order to receive final payments. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.ii.</span></strong> <strong><span>Institute Re-employment</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Consideration for re-employment is based on qualifications and demonstrated ability, as well as prior job performance and fitness for Institute employment. An employee who was terminated by the Institute in a manner such that the employee left not in good standing may not be re-employed. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.jj.</span></strong> <strong><span>Emeritus Status</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Emeritus status may be granted to retiring staff as a special recognition for exemplary work performance and outstanding, loyal, and dedicated service to the Institute. To be eligible for consideration for Emeritus status, an employee must be in retirement status from the Institute, have at least ten years of service in a full-time regular position, be nominated by the senior administrator of her/his department, and have the approval of the VPAA. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.kk.</span></strong> <strong><span>Retirement</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>There is no mandatory retirement age for Institute employees; they may continue working without regard to age, subject to provisions concerning at-will and other termination of employment. Continuing employees nearing age 65 should contact Human Resources regarding Medicare coverage and certain decisions that must be made about health insurance coverage at age 65. </p><p>An employee planning to retire should consult Human Resources six months prior to her/his expected retirement date. </p><p>Retirement plan participants should initiate procedures for receipt of retirement income benefits by writing directly to the retirement plan office. Payment of benefits to any continuing employee who participates in a retirement plan is subject to terms established by that plan. </p><p>Although the Institute has no retirement age, work restrictions may be imposed under TIAA-CREF. Employees should refer to the TIAA-CREF summary plan description for details.<em> </em></p><p><strong><span>D.1.ll.</span></strong> <strong><span>Reductions in Force</span></strong><em> </em></p><p>Under some circumstances, the Institute may restructure or reduce its workforce. If so, the Institute will make a reasonable effort to inform affected employees in advance. Employees to be laid off will be told the expected duration of the layoff if known. In determining which employees will be laid off, the Institute will identify the positions to be reduced and in selecting for retention among staff members performing in the same position to be reduced, will consider its operating requirements and other factors, including employees’ skills, productivity, ability, past performance, and, where other factors are equal in its judgment, their length of service. </p><p><strong><span>D.1.mm.</span></strong> <strong><span>Exit Interview</span></strong> </p><p>Employees ending employment at the Institute, whether voluntarily or involuntarily are strongly encouraged to meet with Human Resources staff for an exit interview. This interview will normally occur on or before the employee’s final workday. During the interview, the Manager of Human Resources or designee may ask for information about working conditions and the employee’s relationship with her/his supervisor and fellow staff members and will discuss employment benefits conversion. The employee also will have the opportunity to suggest ways to improve Institute operations. It is the employee’s responsibility to return all Institute property (vehicles, keys, identification cards, parking permit, credit cards, laptop computers, uniforms, etc.) by her/his final day of employment. </p></div></div></div>          </section>
