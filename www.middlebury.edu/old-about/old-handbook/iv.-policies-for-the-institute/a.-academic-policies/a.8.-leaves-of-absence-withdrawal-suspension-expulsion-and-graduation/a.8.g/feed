 <title>A.8.g. Return of Title IV (Federal) Funds</title>
 <link>https://www.middlebury.edu/old-about/old-handbook/iv.-policies-for-the-institute/a.-academic-policies/a.8.-leaves-of-absence-withdrawal-suspension-expulsion-and-graduation/a.8.g./node/591177</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If a Title IV (federal aid) eligible student withdraws because of being called to active duty, or has been otherwise impacted by military mobilization, the school must perform the Return of Title IV Funds calculations that are required by the statute and regulations (34 CFR 668.22). If those calculations result in the school being required to return funds to one or more of the Title IV (federal aid) programs, it must do so. In many cases such a return of funds by the school will reduce the student&#039;s loan debt. An institution, however, is not required to collect an overpayment of grant funds based on the Return of Title IV Funds calculation for such a student. Therefore, the school is not required to contact the student, notify NSLDS, or refer the overpayment to the Department in these cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
