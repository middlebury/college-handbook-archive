 <title>A.8.a. Leave of Absence - Student Initiated</title>
 <link>https://www.middlebury.edu/old-about/old-handbook/iv.-policies-for-the-institute/a.-academic-policies/a.8.-leaves-of-absence-withdrawal-suspension-expulsion-and-graduation/a.8.a.-leave-of-absence---student-initiated/node/591159</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student may register for a leave of absence for up to two years if s/he has successfully completed at least one semester at the Middlebury Institute, is in good academic standing, and has met all financial obligations to the Institute. A leave of absence is approved for one year at a time, and the student must request an extension to continue the leave into a second year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to register for a leave of absence, the student must file a petition for a Leave of Absence form in the Records Office and a non-refundable deposit of $150 must be paid by 4 P.M. on the third day of the first term of absence (Fall or Spring; Summer term is excepted). The deposit is applicable toward the student’s tuition upon returning to the Institute. Unless this procedure is followed, a returning student must apply for readmission through the Admissions Office and pay another application fee. Please obtain the petition for a Leave of Absence from the Records Office. &lt;strong&gt;International students&lt;/strong&gt; may be required to leave the U.S. during a leave of absence if they have not officially transferred to another academic institution or applied for a change of status through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students should be aware that since they are not enrolled during a leave of absence, this might cause student loan payments to fall due.&lt;/strong&gt; Students receiving any federal financial aid and/or a Middlebury Institute scholarship should obtain advice and instructions on leaves of absence from the Office of Student Financial Services and schedule an exit interview, which is required by federal regulations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event that a student is going on a leave of absence in order to pursue a degree program-related internship, fellowship or Peace Corps service, the settlement of tuition overloads before departure may be waived by completing the required Leave of Absence Petition. However, if a student fails to return and re-enroll, he/she is liable for those charges at the prevailing rate. The petition is available from the Records Office. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Students going on a leave of absence for any other reason are required to pay their overload credits before leaving the Institute. Please see Course Load and Overload section, above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon return from a leave of absence, the student must have no outstanding balance due and have a $150 non-refundable deposit on account. The $150 tuition deposit will be applied against billed tuition in the returning semester. The deposit is good for a maximum of two years, after which the student must re-apply for admission to the Institute. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; No student will be allowed to register if there is a balance due on his or her tuition account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
