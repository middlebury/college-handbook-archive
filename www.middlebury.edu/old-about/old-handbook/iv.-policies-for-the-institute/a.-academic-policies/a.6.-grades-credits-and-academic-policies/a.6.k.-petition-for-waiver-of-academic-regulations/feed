 <title>A.6.k. Petition for Waiver of Academic Regulations</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students who wish to be considered for a waiver of any&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;academic policy or requirement for any degree program should obtain a Petition for Waiver of Academic Regulations from the Records Office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The student should specify on the Petition which&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;academic policy or requirement s/he wishes to waive, and why the waiver is necessary and justified. Additional documentation may be submitted with the form which supports the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signatures of support must be obtained on the Petition from the relevant instructor and/or Program Chair. For petitions that involve meeting language requirements, students must obtain the signature of Language Studies Advisor. In cases where tuition is involved, the Office of Student Financial Planning must also sign the Petition. Once all relevant signatures are obtained, the student should submit the form to the Associate Dean of Academic Operations. The Records Office shall advise students as to which signatures are required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A petition for waiver may be granted or denied at the discretion of the Associate Dean of Academic Operations. If granted, the waiver must be filed in the student’s record in the Records Office before the waiver becomes official. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; if a requirement is waived, the total number of credits required for graduation in each program is not affected by the waiver, i.e. credit is not given for courses that are waived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
