 <title>A.6.d. Pass/Fail (P/F) Option</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In certain courses identified by each Graduate School, students receive a grade of P (Pass) or F (Fail). Grades of “P/F” will be awarded only in those courses that are identified as such in the course schedule or syllabus, and there is no other grading system applied to such courses. All multiple sections of a given course must be treated equally in terms of grading. Criteria determining passing work under the P/F option are at the discretion of the instructor of record. When a student receives a “Pass” in a “Pass/Fail” course, credit is received, but those credits are not counted in calculating student’s Grade Point Average. When a student receives a “Fail” in a “Pass/Fail” course, the student does not earn any credits for the &quot;F&quot; grade but the credits are used in the GPA hours total used to calculate the GPA, thus negatively affecting the GPA. (Example: A student with an F in a one-credit workshop and 15 other credits will have 16 hours used to calculate the GPA. Assuming all the other courses received an A the student&#039;s GPA would be 60 (quality points) divided by 16 credits, giving the student a GPA of 3.75.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
