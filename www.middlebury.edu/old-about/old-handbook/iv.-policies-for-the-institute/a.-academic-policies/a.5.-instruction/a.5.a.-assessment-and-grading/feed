Faculty are therefore accorded wide latitude to set standards, establish expectations, evaluate performance, and assign grades. Faculty also have the right to expect a committed and appropriate level of effort and performance from their students. Conversely, students have the right to receive information as to what is expected of them in a course, including the general criteria for evaluation of their performance. Faculty shall provide their students with information as to the grade parameters, criteria, and requirements at the beginning of each course, normally doing so in the course syllabus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
