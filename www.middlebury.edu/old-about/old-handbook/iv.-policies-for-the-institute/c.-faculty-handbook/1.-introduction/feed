Purpose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The purpose of this Faculty Handbook is to define faculty relationships within the academic community of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (hereafter &quot;the Institute&quot;). In particular, it sets forth the responsibilities, duties, and roles of the faculty, and the means by which the faculty as a body, through its committees, through its program chairs, and individually, participate in the governance process, the formulation and administration of academic policies, and personnel actions involving the employment of faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The working definition of faculty governance for the Institute can be found in this Preamble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portions of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all&quot;&gt;Section 1. Middlebury-Wide Policies&lt;/a&gt; also provide information that applies to faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of employment of faculty members are determined by reference to the written letter of faculty appointment to the faculty member (which normally states a specific period of appointment); the Faculty Handbook; and those sections of Employee Handbook that apply to faculty. These terms are continued with each new letter of appointment received on contract renewals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Faculty Handbook is the result of consultation among the Faculty Senate; the Faculty Assembly; administrative leadership, including deans and associate deans, the vice president for academic affairs and dean of the Institute (VPAA), the Middlebury provost and president, the Institute Board of Advisors, and the Middlebury Board of Trustees. This version of the handbook is considered active, and changes will be archived on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.1.b. Academic Policy-making and Administration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Academic policies are those relating to the education of students at the Institute. This includes instruction, research, curriculum development, institutional service, professional service, faculty &lt;abbr title=&quot;For the purposes of this handbook, evaluation refers to a faculty member&#039;s past performance, and is intended to offer both a summative assessment as well as to give formative feedback to inform future faculty development efforts. Evaluation of the faculty serves several Institute objectives, such as assuring and assessing educational effectiveness, providing performance feedback, developing faculty expertise, improving classroom performance, maintaining fairness, and documenting the basis for employment decisions. For the purposes of this handbook, development refers to the increase in capacity for a faculty member&#039;s future performance. A hallmark of professionals is that they also continually develop and update their knowledge and skills. Intentional, ongoing professional development is expected of all Institute faculty.&quot;&gt;development and evaluation&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic policy-making is a shared responsibility, with the various members of the Institute and broader Middlebury communities contributing according to their respective areas of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic policies are subject to ongoing review and updating. They are officially maintained in the Policies and Standards Manual, access to which is provided to all faculty and students through the Institute’s Web site found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/iv.-policies-for-the-institute/a.-academic-policies&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.1.c. Graduate Schools&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;To accomplish its mission, the Institute is organized into two schools, and an office for language and professional programs, each headed by a dean, research centers headed by directors, and various staff to manage academic support functions. See the webpage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/faculty-staff/organizational-resources/charts-contacts&quot;&gt;Organizational Charts and Contacts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The schools are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Graduate School of International Policy and Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Graduate School of Translation, Interpretation, and Language Education&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.1.d. Research Centers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Institute recognizes, encourages, and supports research for the purpose of accomplishing the educational mission of the Institute, enhancing its reputation, and facilitating the professional currency of the faculty. Any research center or project established at the Institute is bound by the laws, regulations, and policies applicable to all staff, faculty, and organizations at the Middlebury Institute. The directors of such centers report to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, and should consult regularly with Institute Deans. Certain research center directors and staff members may have faculty appointments, issued in accordance with the appointment procedures described in this Handbook. Current research centers and projects at the Institute are described on the Institute’s website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
