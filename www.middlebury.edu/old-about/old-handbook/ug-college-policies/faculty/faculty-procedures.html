Article II Organization of the Faculty</strong></p><p><strong>a. </strong><em><strong>Section 1 Officers</strong></em></p><p>i. The faculty moderator, elected in accordance with the provisions in b. Section 2 below, will serve as the presiding officer at all plenary sessions of the faculty.

The first ballot will include the names of all those who have consented to have their names put before the faculty as nominees. Faculty members will vote for one name from this ballot. If a candidate receives more than fifty percent of the votes cast on this ballot, that person will be elected as moderator. If no candidate receives more than fifty percent of the votes cast on the first ballot, a second ballot will be held listing the names of the two candidates who received the highest number of votes. Faculty members will vote for one name from this ballot. The candidate with the largest number of votes will be elected as moderator. In the case of tied votes for first or second place on the initial ballot, all of the names of the tied candidates will appear on the second ballot. If no candidate obtains more than fifty percent of the votes cast, a third ballot will be held listing the names of the two candidates who obtained the highest number of votes on the second ballot. Faculty members will vote for one on this ballot. The candidate with the largest number of votes will be elected as moderator.</p><p><strong>c. </strong><em><strong>Section 3 Divisions, Departments and Programs</strong></em></p><p>The several divisions, departments and programs of instruction comprising the administrative organization for the instructional work of the College will serve also as component parts of the faculty, where appropriate.</p><p><em><strong>d.
