 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vermont Earned Sick Time Act (21 V.S.A. §§ 481–486) provides that employers must allow eligible employees to accrue a bank of hours that may be used as paid time off for certain health or safety needs and/or for the care of a qualifying family member.  Three of Middlebury’s employee paid time off policies - Combined Time Off (CTO), Faculty Leave Reserve (FLR) and Vermont Earned Sick Time (VEST) - meet or exceed the provisions of this law. Eligibility for paid time off benefits is based on employment classification and work state: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;benefits-eligible staff employees fall under the CTO policy,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;benefits-eligible faculty members have FLR, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;certain student employees as well as non-benefits eligible faculty and staff employees&lt;em&gt; who work in Vermont&lt;/em&gt; may be eligible for VEST. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees should refer to the Combined Time Off, Faculty Sick Leave Reserve or Vermont Earned Sick Time policies for specific eligibility and benefit provisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
