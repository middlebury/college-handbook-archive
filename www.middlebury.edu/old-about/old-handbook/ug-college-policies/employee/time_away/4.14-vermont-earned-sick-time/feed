Routine healthcare treatment includes travel to and from an appointment, a pharmacy, or other location related to the purpose for which time was taken.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accompanying the employee’s parent, grandparent, spouse or parent-in-law to an appointment related to his or her long-term care. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arranging for social or legal services or obtaining medical care or counseling for a parent, grandparent, spouse, child, brother, sister, parent-in-law, grandchild or foster child who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Care for a parent, grandparent, spouse, child, brother, sister, parent-in-law, grandchild or foster child because the school or business where the individual is normally located during the employee’s workday is closed for public health or safety reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VEST may not be used for personal absences such as for family vacation or for scheduled school closings or for any other reason not specifically outlined in this policy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VEST Waiting and Accrual Period &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VEST accrues on an annual basis; to be eligible for an accrual an employee must have been employed for a full year and have averaged 18 or more paid hours (including: regular worked time, overtime, and any other paid time) for the period. Average hours are calculated by dividing total hours worked in the year by 52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first pay period after the year ends eligible employees will be credited with a lump sum accrual of 1 hour of VEST for each 52 hours paid &lt;em&gt;up to a maximum accrual of 24 hours per year&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carryover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accrued, unused VEST will carryover at the end of the calendar year up to a maximum of 40 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using VEST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;VEST can be used to &lt;em&gt;replace scheduled work time&lt;/em&gt; (that is, it cannot be used for time an employee is not scheduled to work) which was missed for qualifying health or safety reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VEST is used in increments of not less than 15 minutes and not greater than the length of the scheduled shift.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employees must make reasonable efforts to avoid scheduling routine or preventative healthcare during work hours.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employees must provide reasonable advance notification of their need to use VEST, following established departmental procedures for requesting time off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employees who are absent for longer than three days may be required to give medical evidence of illness and/or medical certification of fitness to return to work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;VEST is paid at employees’ regular hourly rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employees may be asked to provide reasonable proof that their use of VEST is for a purpose allowed by the policy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recording time used:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Non-exempt (hourly) staff and student employees&lt;/span&gt;: use the VST earn code to record time on BannerWeb timesheets. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Exempt (salaried) staff and faculty employees&lt;/span&gt;: record used VEST hours by emailing &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hr@middlebury.edu&quot;&gt;hr@middlebury.edu&lt;/a&gt; and copying direct supervisor within 1 week of the used time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Important Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;VEST is not recognized as hours worked for purposes of calculating eligibility for overtime pay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Employees are not entitled to be paid for accrued but unused VEST upon resignation or other termination of employment; accrued, unused balances will be forfeited at termination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Available VEST balances may be viewed in Banner Web (Employee/Time Off Current Balances and History).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VEST hours used will show on employee paystubs and may be viewed in Banner Web. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An employee who transfers to work in a state other than Vermont will no longer accrue VEST but may continue to use VEST that has already accrued. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An employee who transfers from a VEST eligible position into a position eligible for CTO will have his/her accrued, unused VEST balance transferred to SLR and may use that code to record time used for any purpose allowable under VEST. Similarly, an employee who transfers from a VEST eligible position into a position eligible for Faculty Leave Reserve (FLR) will have his/her accrued, unused VEST balance transferred to FLR.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no cash-out of accrued VEST under any circumstances.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vest may not be used for any purpose not specifically covered by this policy.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
