 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If an employee is unable to report  to work for any reason, it is his or her responsibility to notify the supervisor  as soon as possible prior to the start of the workday. If the employee is unable  to reach the supervisor, s/he should follow the department&#039;s procedure for  notification. Failure to notify the College of an absence before the start of  the workday means the absence is unauthorized and can lead to disciplinary  action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
