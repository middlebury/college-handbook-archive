&lt;p&gt;In compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and the Vermont Parental Leave Act, the College grants up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave to an eligible employee during a rolling 12 month period. FMLA leaves of absence can be granted for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The birth of a child and in order to care for that newborn child, within one year of the birth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The placement of a child for adoption or foster care, within one year of the initial placement. Leave may be taken prior to the event if necessary to arrange for the event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To care for a spouse, domestic/civil union partner, child, parent, or parent-in-law with a serious health condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To respond to a medical emergency involving the employee&#039;s child, stepchild, foster child, or ward who lives with the employee, or the employee&#039;s parent, spouse, domestic partner/civil union partner, or parent-in-law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The serious health condition of the employee that renders the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any “qualifying exigency” arising from a spouse, son, daughter, or parent’s federal call to duty of National Guard or Reservists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FMLA also allows up to 26 weeks of unpaid leave during a rolling 12 month period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or nearest blood relative injured while on active military duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy is designed to offer assistance by providing job-protected leave to eligible employees for certain family and medical reasons. The leave may be unpaid, paid, or a combination of unpaid and paid depending on the circumstances as specified in this policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy applies to employment in the United States; it does not apply to employment abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
