 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middlebury College values employees&#039; contributions to the successful operation of the College, expecting a productive and mutually satisfactory employment relationship. It is understood, however, that the employment relationship between Middlebury College and its employees is at-will, meaning that either the College or the employee may terminate that relationship with or without notice or cause, at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Resources will provide departing employees with a packet of information summarizing changes to employee benefits, conversion privileges, repayment of outstanding debts to the College, and return of College-owned property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
