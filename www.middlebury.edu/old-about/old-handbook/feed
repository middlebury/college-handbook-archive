Personal and professional integrity have many components that extend beyond the specifics of Middlebury’s honor code, and they encompass a broader ethical practice of inquiry pursued with rigor and honesty.  Professional integrity requires recognition of the expertise of past and current communities of scholars and students, and necessitates critical evaluation of this received knowledge. It also demands honest and transparent reporting of research, observation, and experimental evidence, consistent with the respective standards of our disciplines.  On a personal level, integrity calls for recognition of the limits of one’s own knowledge and expertise at any moment in time, and demands curiosity and creativity in the face of those limits. It also means the willingness to take a principled stand even when it is unpopular, and equal willingness to admit error. Correspondingly, given that interpretations and arguments are contestable, having integrity means acknowledging alternative understandings as well as allowing others to examine them. Above all, integrity requires awareness of the ways in which personal and institutional power can threaten academic freedom and a commitment to protect it equally and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic freedom and integrity are necessary but not sufficient to pursue knowledge and critical engagement with the wider world.  Engagement with the ideas and experiences of others are also key guards against our own individual limitations and biases.  We, as members of this academic community, therefore recognize the fundamental principle of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;mutual respect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We aspire to demonstrate intellectual range and emotional generosity by opening ourselves to different perspectives.  As an institution, Middlebury is committed to creating an atmosphere in which all of its members live and work free from discrimination and harassment. Its defense of academic freedom must be waged in conjunction with the principle of civil discourse. While disagreement is inevitable and acceptable in a free and diverse community, we strive, on both individual and institutional levels, to cultivate respect and responsibility for self, others, and our shared environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left:30px&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;--Adopted by the President in August 2018, upon the endorsement by the Middlebury College Faculty and the Faculty of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
