&lt;p&gt;The College encourages employees to accept their civic responsibility if they  are called for jury duty. All full- and part-time employees, excluding temporary  employees, will be paid for time off for required jury duty. The employee&#039;s  status at the College will remain the same and all benefits will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When called for jury duty, the employee must notify the supervisor and  provide subsequent notification of jury duty related absences. The College will  continue to pay the eligible employee for scheduled hours missed due to jury  duty. Whenever employees are released from jury duty for partial or full days,  they are expected to report for work at the College. An employee&#039;s time record  must accurately reflect jury duty service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
