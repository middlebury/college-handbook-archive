 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If employees disagree with any  decisions from Human Resources related to their compensation, they should review  the disagreement with their supervisor and department head. The supervisor and  department head should be sure that the employee&#039;s expectations under the  compensation program are reasonable and that the employee understands the  program as it relates to his or her particular situation. Following the evaluation,  if the supervisor determines there needs to be further review, the supervisor or  department head and the employee should make an appointment with Human Resources  to discuss the position and the decision. Human Resources will reevaluate its  original position in light of any new information. The decision resulting from  the Human Resources review will be final.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
