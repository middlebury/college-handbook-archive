Review and Reappointment in the Department of Physical Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Review Schedule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The athletic director will review all instructors and assistants in the Department of Physical Education and Athletics on an annual basis.  Reviews of coaches who do not have head coaching responsibilities will be conducted in conjunction with the appropriate head coach(es).  Evaluations of all instructors in physical education will focus on their promise and performance as coaches, and as physical education instructors.  Reviews will generally occur at the conclusion of the coaches&#039; prime coaching season, and final recommendations will be forwarded to the dean of the College by May 10, with notification taking place as specified in section 4.f. Notification Date, of the Faculty Handbook &quot;Rules of Appointment and Tenure for Academic Faculty.&quot;  After two consecutive, one-year contracts, an instructor may be offered a two-year contract, which may be renewed at the conclusion of the first two-year contract.  After six years as an instructor in physical education, assuming positive evaluations, the coach may be awarded a three-year contract, and will be appointed to the rank of assistant in physical education.  Coaches who do not have &quot;head&quot; coaching responsibilities are limited to attaining the rank of assistant in physical education and can be awarded renewable three-year term contracts following written recommendation by the director of athletics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New head coaches, with previous coaching experience, may be hired at the rank of assistant in physical education, and initially awarded a three-year contract.  Upon satisfactory yearly reviews, a second three-year contract may be granted, and annual reviews by the director of athletics will continue on a yearly basis.  After six years as an assistant in physical education, assuming positive evaluations and the satisfactory completion of the major review, a head coach will be promoted to associate in physical education and will receive a renewable five-year contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt;First Five-Year Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  During the sixth year at the rank of assistant in physical education, the Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment (PEACOR), composed of the Senior Woman Administrator (SWA), a senior associate in physical education, elected by the members of the department, and the chair of the Athletic Policy Committee of the Faculty (APC), will initiate a major review to determine whether the head coach under review will be promoted to the rank of associate in physical education and awarded a renewable five-year contract.  The director of Athletics and the dean of the College will serve in advisory capacities to PEACOR during its proceedings.  To be considered for this promotion a head coach must be judged to be an outstanding coach and teacher, based upon the performance criteria listed below.  The PEACOR will forward its recommendation to the dean of the College and the president for final approval.  A head coach who is not offered a five-year contract will be offered a one-year terminal contract, and notified in writing regarding the new contract as specified in section 4.f. Notification Date, of the Faculty Handbook &quot;Rules of Appointment and Tenure for Academic Faculty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: This review is of major importance, since it parallels an academic professors&#039; review for tenure, and accordingly the granting of associate rank.  The granting of a multi-year renewable contract is a significant one, in that the college is acknowledging its desire to provide contractual stability to the coach, based on continued outstanding coaching and teaching performance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Five-Year Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; During the fifth year the associate in physical education will undergo a second review by the PEACOR.  The procedures of the review will be the same as for the first five-year review.  The PEACOR will notify the dean of the College and the president of its recommendation, and the coach will receive written notification as specified in section 4.f. Notification Date, of the Faculty Handbook &quot;Rules of Appointment and Tenure for Academic Faculty.&quot;  Upon a positive review, the associate will be granted a second five-year contract.  If the review is unsatisfactory, the coach will be offered a two-year terminal contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;d. Seven-Year Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In the tenth year at the rank of associate in physical education the head coach will be reviewed by the PEACOR.  Evaluations by the PEACOR will be acted upon as previously described.  Upon a positive review, the associate will be promoted to the rank of senior associate and granted a seven-year contract.  If the review is unsatisfactory, the coach will be offered a two-year terminal contract.  These reviews will continue every seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Note: Colleagues moving through the process granted 3-year rolling contracts prior to September 1, 2002 will move through the Associate and Senior Associate ranks with Major Reviews at 5 years at the Associate Level and every seven years at the Senior Associate Level.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;e. Appeal Process. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In the event the PEACOR does not recommend promotion and a multi-year contract, any appeals will follow the procedures stated in the Appeals section in the Faculty Handbook.  References in this section to the Reappointments and Promotions Committee, will be relegated to the Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment, and followed in the same manner through the appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;f.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination for Cause. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Termination of a contract may occur at any time and will follow the provisions of section c. of &quot;Special Provisions&quot; in the Faculty Handbook.  The Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment will perform the role of the Promotions Committee in section c.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;g.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reappointment and Review Criteria&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All coaching faculty are hired with the expectation of being outstanding teachers.  All coaches are expected to value the role that they play in the education of their student-athletes, and will be actively supportive in insuring that their students&#039; opportunity to excel in their academic pursuits is always viewed as being of paramount importance.  The pursuit of excellence is an attitude that all coaches will attempt to instill in their athletes, to the extent that this pursuit will be evident in their academic growth, in their positive contributions made to the campus community, and in their athletic endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coaching faculty are evaluated in the areas listed below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commitment to the core mission of the College&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;margin:0px 0px 1em;

Review Procedures in the Department of Physical Education and Athletics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annual review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Prior to May 10th, the athletic director will meet individually with each head coach.  Prior to the meeting the athletic director will gather information from the following sources to assist in the evaluation: 1) Physical Education evaluation forms and a written summary of evaluation from the director of physical education, 2) Student assessment of coaching forms to be completed by all team members, 3) Written summation of captains evaluation meeting with the athletic director, 4) Coaching year-end self evaluation form and 5) the athletic director will have personally observed a minimum of one practice and one varsity contest. Reviews of coaches who do not have head coaching responsibilities will be conducted in conjunction with the appropriate head coach(es) and reviewed by the director of athletics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluation Process - The athletic director will provide a written evaluation to the candidates based on the year-end evaluation form.  Areas of strengths will be noted, and a plan will be formulated to address any areas of weakness.  If the evaluation is negative and the review falls at the end of a contract period, the coach will be notified in writing as specified in section 4.f. Notification Date, of the Faculty Handbook &quot;Rules of Appointment and Tenure for Academic Faculty.&quot;  A head coach or assistant coach with no &quot;head&quot; coaching responsibility on an extended contract (two or three years) will not be terminated in the final year of the contract unless the coach has been notified in writing of previous shortcoming that would need to be improved upon to the satisfaction of the athletic director or head coach during the final year of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b. First Five-Year Review. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Because of the variety of forms of instruction, and the multiplicity of tasks that are required in coaching, the PEACOR will examine all possible avenues to assure that evidence of coaching and teaching excellence is assured.  A satisfactory review is required in order for the head coach to be considered for a renewable five-year contract.  This review should clearly show that the coach is already an outstanding head coach and teacher.  All review materials must be submitted to the committee by March 1.  The committee will gather assessment information in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i.  The Candidate&lt;br /&gt;(a) The head coach will provide a complete vita of all professional accomplishments and service contributions, as well as a self-evaluation that concentrates on these accomplishments and contributions with reference to the criteria listed in section 1.g.vii., above.  This self-evaluation should also address the coach&#039;s plans for future professional growth.&lt;br /&gt;(b) The coach will provide copies of organizational plans, playbook, published articles, etc., and any other data to support their coaching abilities and professional growth.&lt;br /&gt;(c) To furnish the PEACOR with a list of professional colleagues outside Middlebury who would be appropriate to evaluate the candidate&#039;s professional achievements. A minimum of four will be required.&lt;br /&gt;(d) The candidate may seek up to two written comments from non-departmental colleagues from within the college community.&lt;br /&gt;(e) Seek written comment from the admissions office liaison, if it is applicable.&lt;br /&gt;(f) To provide PEACOR through the director of athletics, or the director&#039;s designate, an appropriate schedule of practice or physical education class visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ii.  Physical Education and Athletics Committee on Reappointment (PEACOR)&lt;br /&gt;(a) To meet with the candidates for the first review, in a group or individually, to explain to them the procedures; and to invite the candidates to submit, either orally or in writing, any additional information that may be pertinent to their reviews. A candidate&#039;s decision not to submit such materials is in no way prejudicial to reappointment. &lt;br /&gt;(b) The PEACOR will utilize all of the evaluative tools that are used in the annual reviews, and will have access to previous yearly performance reviews. The athletic director will include a summation of these evaluations for the committee in order to bring perspective.&lt;br /&gt;(c) To arrange with the candidate an appropriate schedule to observe at least one practice and/or physical education class and one scheduled athletic contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iii.  Dean of the College&lt;br /&gt;(a) To initiate the review in a timely fashion so that all necessary information and documentation may be obtained from the candidate and other sources.&lt;br /&gt;(b) To solicit information, on behalf of the PEACOR, from candidates under review; to gather information from other sources when so requested by the PEACOR.&lt;br /&gt;(c) To serve as recording secretary of the PEACOR.&lt;br /&gt;(d) To provide counsel to the PEACOR during the course of its deliberations.&lt;br /&gt;(e) To provide counsel to the president when the PEACOR&#039;s deliberations are completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iv. Director of Athletics&lt;br /&gt;(a) To maintain the candidates&#039; review files, including teaching evaluation forms.&lt;br /&gt;(b) The director of athletics will seek written peer reviews from all department members with senior associate or associate status not serving on PEACOR and will write a letter, without attribution, that summarizes views of those department members. At the discretion of the director of athletics a candidate may be asked to write a letter for a colleague under review.&lt;br /&gt;(c) To serve in an advisory capacity to the PEACOR during the course of its deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;v. President&lt;br /&gt;(a) To hear reports from the PEACOR on the substance of its conclusions about each constituent part of the case and about the case as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;(b) To consult with the dean of the College about the individual cases.&lt;br /&gt;(c) To challenge any conclusion of the PEACOR with which he or she disagrees and give the PEACOR an opportunity to respond.&lt;br /&gt;(d) In the case of a reversal of the committee&#039;s recommendation, to explain to the committee the reasons for doing so, reasons which in a written summary become part of the review file.&lt;br /&gt;(e) To make the final decision and to notify the candidate in a letter that indicates the recommendation of the PEACOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;c.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Five-Year Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The procedure for review will be exactly the same as for the first five-year review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;d.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seven-year Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The procedure for the review will be exactly the same as for the second five-year review. Outside recommendations will not be sought by the committee, but may be provided by the coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confidentiality and Access for review materials in the Department of Physical Education and Athletics.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Letters from students, and from peers both within and outside the institution, are always confidential, and will be made available to the candidate only in the event of a contract being denied.  All student evaluation forms will be made available to the candidate, as well as to the committee.  The athletic director will include a summation of these evaluations for the committee in order to bring perspective.  This summation will be made available to the candidate, prior to its submission to the committee.  The athletic director will also write a letter that summarizes, without attribution, the written views of the department members with associate or senior status in the department and it will be available to the candidate at the time it is submitted to the committee.  The dean of the College, the provost, and the president, as well as all members of the PEACOR will have access to all the materials requested in section&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-taxonomy-vocabulary-1 field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/taxonomy/term/8881&quot;&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/taxonomy/term/14071&quot;&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/taxonomy/term/22741&quot;&gt;faculty policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/taxonomy/term/30431&quot;&gt;PEACOR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
