 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middlebury College seeks to maintain a healthy, comfortable, and productive work environment. In addition, the College must remain in absolute compliance with fire and safety regulations. The College seeks also to comply with the laws of the State of Vermont governing smoking in public areas. Vermont law prohibits smoking in most public places. The Middlebury College workplace is a smoke-free environment. In compliance with state regulations, all areas in the College are smoke-free. Furthermore, smoking is prohibited in all residence halls, including the small houses occupied by students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking shall not take place within 25 feet of areas where smoke is likely to enter buildings.Â  This includes building entranceways, near open windows, and especially near building air intakes. Additionally, in areas where there is a high frequency of problematic smoking, signs will be placed to remind community members not to smoke in that area. An annual reminder will be sent out at the beginning of the academic year and during summer language programs to help to educate the community about these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
