 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the purposes of this policy, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;weapon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is defined as:  any firearm, explosive, knife (with a blade six inches or longer in length or with blades less than six inches which, by design, can be used as weapons, such as switchblades or double-edged blades) or other object that has been designed with the intent to harm a person or deface property.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weapons are prohibited on the Middlebury College campus. Replicas of weapons are also prohibited unless they are possessed or stored in accordance to the Exceptions and Storage sections below. Discovery of a weapon in a College building, residence hall, on College grounds, locked in a vehicle on College grounds, or in the possession of a student or employee on campus, or any other violation of the weapons regulations, may result in confiscation of the weapon and disciplinary action against the owner and/or person in possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matriculated students and students enrolled in a Middlebury College program and living on campus are permitted, in accordance with Vermont law, to possess weapons for hunting and related activities, such as target practice.  A handgun is only allowed to be on campus if it is a duty weapon issued or authorized by the student-owner’s employer. All weapons must be registered and stored with the Department of Public Safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to their realistic likeness to weapons and potential for causing community alarm, possession or use of toy or replica weapons in a College-sanctioned activity or academic program must be approved in advance by the director of Public Safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Public Safety provides weapon storage for the exceptions noted above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Storage is limited to one weapon per person.     &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Middlebury College weapon permit may be issued for one academic year or the length of the student’s program. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Owners must provide a soft case for the storage of their weapon.   &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the weapon is a firearm, a chamber locking device must be provided and attached by the owner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Owner’s must claim and remove their weapon from campus at the close of the academic term or at the time they move out of campus student housing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any violation of this policy will result in the loss of the privilege to store a weapon on campus and may result in disciplinary action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any request to store more than one weapon must be submitted in writing to the director of Public Safety at least 15 business days prior to the start of the academic program.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
