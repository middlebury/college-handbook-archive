Introduction</strong></h4><p>Middlebury College (“Middlebury”) is committed to providing a campus and workplace environment that is safe and secure for all students, staff, faculty and others who participate in Middlebury’s programs. Sexual misconduct (including sexual assault), domestic and dating violence and misconduct, stalking, and related retaliation, as defined by this policy (henceforth referred to as the "SMDVS Policy"), are strictly prohibited. Middlebury will take reasonable, prompt and appropriate action to respond to sexual misconduct (including sexual assault), domestic and dating violence and misconduct, stalking and related retaliation where such conduct impacts or has the potential to impact the Middlebury program-based educational, residential, or employment environment of any member of the Middlebury community. Such action could include discipline for employees such as written reprimands, salary freezes (faculty) or termination of employment, or discipline for students such as probationary status, a letter of official discipline, suspension or expulsion from any or all programs in which the student is enrolled or participating. It could also entail non-disciplinary measures such as No Contact Orders and/or No Trespass Orders, training, and providing safety and support services to complainants and affected parties, as appropriate. Factors to be considered in determining sanctions are listed in <a href="#Sanction">Section 10 (H)</a>, below. Information about on-campus and off-campus support services (i.e., counseling, health, victim advocacy, legal assistance and other related services) is provided in <a href="#AppC">Appendix C</a>, below.</p><p>Except as otherwise specified herein, this policy applies to faculty, staff and students, as well as to others who participate in Middlebury’s programs and activities (see <a href="#Covered">Section 2, Definitions: Covered Third Parties</a>, below), including the undergraduate college, the Language Schools, the School of the Environment, MiddCore, Bread Loaf School of English, Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference, Middlebury College Schools Abroad, the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey ("the Institute"), and all other Middlebury on- or off-campus programs.</p><p>The procedures for addressing complaints or reports of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking and related retaliation are set forth below.  However, where applicable law mandates different procedures or policies with respect to Middlebury programs outside of Vermont, those procedures or policies will apply.</p><p>Middlebury’s process to address cases of alleged sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence or misconduct, stalking and related retaliation is designed to:</p><ul><li>Consider the complainant's rights, the respondent's rights, the community's safety, and applicable laws and Middlebury policies;</li><li>Provide a timely, fair, impartial, and equitable investigation and adjudication process with thoroughness and respect for all involved parties;</li><li>Protect all parties' privacy to the extent practical, while balancing the need to comply with applicable law, maintain campus safety and provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all students, faculty, staff and covered third parties;</li><li>Hold all individuals found to have violated Middlebury’s policies accountable for their actions and provide appropriate remedies to address the effects of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking and/or related retaliation on the complainant and others.</li></ul><p>The parties will be provided procedural rights as outlined in this policy. Since Middlebury lacks full judicial authority, such as the power to subpoena or place witnesses under oath, an individual’s rights cannot be coextensive with or identical to the rights afforded in a civil or criminal legal proceeding. The procedures outlined below are designed, however, to assure fundamental fairness and to protect individuals from arbitrary or capricious disciplinary action. All adjudicators, investigators, and Middlebury officials shall conduct their proceedings in the spirit of these principles. If exceptional circumstances dictate variation from these procedures, the variation will not invalidate a decision unless it prevented fundamental fairness.</p><h4><strong><a name="Definitions" id="Definitions"></a>2. Definitions</strong></h4><p>The definitions of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking used in this policy are consistent with the Clery Act, as amended effective 2014. Middlebury prohibits the crimes of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking as defined by the Clery Act and this policy. In addition, for the purposes of this policy, the definitions of domestic violence and dating violence expand upon the definitions required under the Clery Act, as amended effective 2014, and include other prohibited behaviors. This policy further expands the list of prohibited behaviors beyond Clery requirements to include the categories of Sexual Exploitation, and Domestic and Dating Misconduct. </p><p>In its primary prevention and awareness programs for incoming students and new employees, and its ongoing prevention and awareness programs for students and employees, Middlebury includes the definitions of sexual assault, the definition of consent in reference to sexual activity, and the definitions of domestic violence, dating violence and stalking that are used by the criminal laws in applicable jurisdictions.  The criminal law definitions used in many of those jurisdictions are described in <a href="#AppA">Appendix A </a> for the sake of information only. However, Middlebury utilizes its own definitions of these prohibited behaviors for purposes of this policy that are consistent with the Clery Act, as amended effective 2014 (and expand upon the Clery act as noted above), and determines responsibility for violations of Middlebury policy through its own procedures and standards of proof (that is, by a preponderance of the evidence standard), not through the procedures or standards of proof employed in the criminal justice system. The definitions outlined immediately below apply as a matter of Middlebury policy in all locations where Middlebury operates its programs.  </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sexual Misconduct</span></strong><br /> Sexual misconduct violates the rights of others, and demonstrates flagrant disregard for the principles of this community. Middlebury seeks to prevent all forms of sexual misconduct, and desires to establish and maintain a safe and healthy environment for all members of the community through sexual misconduct prevention, education, support, and a fair adjudication process. Use of alcohol or other drugs does not minimize or excuse a person’s responsibility for conduct that violates this policy.</p><p>Sexual misconduct may include sexual assault, sexual exploitation, or both. The definitions below are intended to provide clarity, and do not suggest that one behavior is more severe or violating than the other.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><em><strong>Sexual Assault</strong></em><br />Sexual assault may be either rape, fondling without consent, incest, or statutory rape, as defined in the Clery Act and below.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Rape</span> is the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. </p><p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Fondling</span> is the touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent (as defined below) of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of their temporary or permanent mental incapacity. </p><p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Incest</span> is sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law in the applicable jurisdiction. </p><p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Statutory rape</span> is sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent in the applicable jurisdiction. </p><p style="padding-left:30px">Sexual assault can be committed by any person against any other person, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or past or current relationship status. Sexual assault may occur with or without physical resistance or violence.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><em><strong>Sexual Exploitation</strong></em><br />Sexual exploitation occurs when a person takes sexual advantage of another person for the benefit of anyone other than that other person without that other person’s consent. Examples of behavior that could constitute sexual exploitation include but are not limited to the following:</p><ul><li>Intentional non-consensual contact with the private body parts of another person that does not meet the definition of behaviors prohibited under the definition of "Sexual Assault," above;</li><li>Prostituting another person;</li><li>Recording or capturing through any means images (e.g., video, photograph) or audio of another person’s sexual activity, intimate body parts, or nudity without that person’s consent;</li><li>Distributing images (e.g., video, photograph) or audio of another person’s sexual activity, intimate body parts, or nudity, if the individual distributing the images or audio knows or should have known that the person(s) depicted in the images or audio did not consent to such disclosure and object(s) or would object to such disclosure; and</li><li>Viewing another person’s sexual activity, intimate body parts, or nudity in a place where that person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy, without that person’s consent, if the individual viewing the other person’s or persons’ sexual activity, intimate body parts, or nudity in such a place knows or should have known that the person(s) being viewed would object to that.</li></ul><p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><em>Exception</em></span>: Middlebury’s prohibition of sexual exploitation is not intended to prohibit the use of sexually explicit materials that are reasonably related to Middlebury’s academic mission. Specifically, this section is not intended to proscribe or inhibit the use of sexually explicit materials, in or out of the classroom, when in the judgment of a reasonable person they arise appropriately to promote genuine discourse, free inquiry, and learning.</p><p><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Consent</strong></span><br />Consent means words or actions, freely and actively given by each party, which a reasonable person would interpret as a willingness to participate in agreed-upon sexual conduct.</p><p>Consent is not present or valid when a person is incapable of giving consent because they are incapacitated by drugs or alcohol; when intimidation, threats, physical force, or other actions that a reasonable person in that person’s circumstances would consider coercive are applied; when that person is placed in fear that any person will suffer imminent bodily injury; when a physical or mental condition is present such that the person cannot knowingly or voluntarily give consent; or when a person is under the age of 16. Silence, non-communication, or a lack of resistance does not necessarily imply consent. Previous relationships or consent do not imply consent to future sexual conduct. Consent to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent can be rescinded at any time.</p><p>The use of alcohol or drugs does not minimize or excuse a person’s responsibility for committing sexual misconduct, or that person’s responsibility for determining whether another is capable of giving consent, as described above. </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Capability to Give Consent</span></strong><br />An objective standard will be used in determining whether a person is incapable of giving consent due to the person’s incapacitation by the use or consumption of drugs or alcohol, or if a physical or mental condition as described above is present. That is, consent is not present or valid when:</p><p>(a) From the standpoint of a reasonable person, the respondent knew, or reasonably should have known, that the person was incapable of giving consent because the person was incapacitated by the person’s use or consumption of drugs or alcohol, or that the person’s physical or mental condition would prevent knowing and voluntary consent; and</p><p>(b) The person was, in fact, incapable of giving consent because the person was incapacitated by the person’s use or consumption of drugs or alcohol, or the person was incapable of providing knowing or voluntary consent due to a physical or mental condition. </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Coercion</span></strong><br /> Coercion is defined as compelling someone to act by applying pressure, harassment, threats, intimidation, or other actions a reasonable person would consider to be coercive.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>Domestic Violence<br /></strong></span>Domestic violence is violence committed—</p><p>(a) By a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the person subjected to the violence;</p><p>(b) By a person with whom the person subjected to the violence shares a child in common;</p><p>(c) By a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the person subjected to the violence as a spouse or intimate partner;</p><p>(d) By a person similarly situated to a spouse of the person subjected to the violence under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the violence occurred, or</p><p>(e) By any other person against an adult or youth who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the violence occurred.</p><p>For the purposes of this definition, domestic violence includes but is not limited to sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse, if involving individuals who are or have been in a domestic relationship as defined here.</p><p>For the purposes of this definition, "violence" means conduct that involves the use or threatened use of physical force against a person, or creates a reasonable belief that physical force may be used against a person in the course of the conduct.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong></strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Dating Violence</span></strong><br />Dating violence is violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the person subjected to the violence. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the reporting party’s statement and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. </p><p>For the purposes of this definition, dating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse, if involving individuals who are or have been dating as defined here.</p><p>For the purposes of this definition, "violence" means conduct that involves the use or threatened use of physical force against a person, or creates a reasonable belief that physical force may be used against a person in the course of the conduct.</p><p>Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence stated above.  </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Domestic or Dating Misconduct<br /></span></strong>Domestic or dating misconduct is defined as threatening or coercive behavior that does not involve violence, but that occurs in the context of a domestic or dating relationship. The criteria for determining the existence of a domestic or dating relationship are provided in the above definition of Domestic Violence and Dating Violence. Examples of Domestic or Dating Misconduct include but are not limited to the following, when occurring in the context of a domestic or dating relationship: </p><ul><li>conduct that may reasonably be expected to exploit or coerce;</li><li>kidnapping and/or restraint;</li><li>prevention of another’s ability to communicate or move freely;</li><li>violation of another’s privacy;</li><li>unauthorized entry and/or uninvited or unwanted presence in another's room or office.  </li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span><strong>Stalking<br /></strong></span></span>“Stalking” is defined as engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to—</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(a) Fear for the person's safety or the safety of others; or</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(b) Suffer substantial emotional distress.</p><p>For the purposes of this definition—</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(a) Course of conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the alleged stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person's property.</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(b) Reasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the person subjected to the stalking.</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(c) Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.</p><p>Examples of stalking behaviors or activities include, but are not limited to the following, if they occur in the context of stalking as defined above:</p><ul><li>Non-consensual communication, including face-to-face communication, telephone calls, voice messages, e-mails, text messages, written letters, gifts, or any other communications that are unwelcome.</li><li>Use of online, electronic or digital technologies in connection with such communication, including but not limited to:  <span style="text-decoration:underline"><span><strong></strong></span></span> </li></ul><p style="padding-left:60px">◊ Posting of pictures or text in chat rooms or on websites;<br />◊ Sending unwanted/unsolicited e-mail or talk requests;<br />◊ Posting private or public messages on Internet sites, social networks, and/or school bulletin boards;<br />◊ Installing spyware on a person’s computer;<br />◊ Using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) or similar technology to monitor a person.          </p><ul><li>Pursuing, following, waiting for, or showing up uninvited at or near a residence, workplace, classroom, or other places frequented by the person.</li><li>Surveillance or other types of observation including staring or “voyeurism”</li><li>Trespassing</li><li>Vandalism</li><li>Non-consensual touching</li><li>Direct verbal or physical threats</li><li>Gathering information about an individual from friends, family, or co-workers</li><li>Accessing private information through unauthorized means</li><li>Threats to harm self or others</li><li>Defamation and/or lying to others about the person, or</li><li>Using a third party or parties to accomplish any of the above.</li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span><strong></strong></span></span><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Complainant<br /></span></strong>A complainant is usually an individual filing a complaint of a violation of Middlebury policies. In some cases (such as, e.g., cases in which a person involved in an incident of alleged sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or  misconduct, stalking, or related retaliation does not wish to participate in the process but Middlebury decides that the alleged misconduct needs to be investigated), Middlebury may pursue an investigation and adjudication under this policy without a designated complainant. In these cases Middlebury may extend some or all of the rights of a complainant as defined in this policy to affected parties as deemed appropriate by a Human Relations Officer or Judicial Affairs Officer, as applicable.</p><p>For ease of reference, the term “complainant” is also used throughout this policy to refer generally to an individual who was allegedly subjected to prohibited conduct as defined in this policy.  </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Respondent</span></strong><br /> A respondent is an individual whose alleged conduct is being investigated to determine if it is in violation of Middlebury’s policies. See <a href="#Scope">Section 11, Scope of Oversight </a>and <a href="#Pending">Section 12, Pending Discipline</a> at the end of this policy for more information.</p><p>For ease of reference, the term "respondent" is also used throughout this policy to refer generally to an individual who allegedly engaged in prohibited conduct as defined in this policy.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="Covered" id="Covered"></a><a href="#EN1"><strong>Covered Third Parties</strong> [1]<br /></a></span>Under Title IX and/or Middlebury policy, third parties who participate in Middlebury’s programs or activities are protected from sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and misconduct,  stalking and related retaliation arising out of those programs or activities. Such individuals will be referred to in this policy as “covered third parties.” Thus, any covered third party who participates in any Middlebury program or activity may report a complaint of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation under this policy, as applicable. Also, Middlebury will take appropriate action, to the extent practicable given Middlebury’s limited authority, in response to a report or complaint of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation by a student, faculty or staff member against a third party.   </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Human Relations Officer</span><br /> </strong>A Human Relations Officer (“HRO”) is an administrator responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating complaints under this policy. HROs are also the Title IX Coordinator’s designees responsible for overseeing investigations and adjudicating sexual misconduct complaints in accordance with this policy. Contact information may be found in <a href="#AppB">Appendix B</a>.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Judicial Affairs Officer</span></strong><br /> A Judicial Affairs Officer (“JAO”) is an administrator responsible for facilitating the investigation and adjudication of complaints under this policy. JAOs are also the Title IX Coordinator’s designees responsible for facilitating the investigation and adjudication of sexual misconduct complaints in accordance with this policy. Other Middlebury officials may be designated to serve in this capacity as needed. Contact information may be found in <a href="#AppB">Appendix B</a>.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Title IX Coordinator</span></strong><br /> The Title IX Coordinator is the administrator responsible for coordinating Middlebury’s efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX. The Title IX Coordinator’s responsibilities include overseeing the process for handling and responding to all complaints of possible sex discrimination and identifying and addressing any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints. Middlebury’s Title IX Coordinator also participates in Middlebury’s handling and responding to complaints of sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, and stalking, as defined in this policy. Contact information may be found in <a href="#AppB">Appendix B</a>; see also <a href="#AppD">Appendix D.</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Responsible Employees</span></strong><br /> Responsible employees include the Title IX Coordinator, HROs and JAOs. These employees have the authority to redress sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, stalking and related retaliation under Middlebury’s policies. Other Middlebury employees may also be “responsible employees,” to the extent described in <a href="#confidentiality">Section 3(B), Non-Confidential Resources,</a> below.  Responsible employees have a duty to report incidents that potentially involve these types of misconduct to Middlebury's Title IX Coordinator or designees (e.g., HROs or JAOs).</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Confidential Resources</span></strong><br /> Confidential resources include the staff of the Parton Center for Health and Wellness, the staff of the Chaplain’s office, Middlebury Safe and Confidential Advocates (“MiddSafe” <a href="#EN2">[2]</a>) or other medical, counseling, support or religious personnel and volunteers who are required by law to maintain confidentiality. For more information, see <a href="#confidentiality">Section 3, Confidentiality,</a> below. </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">No Contact Order</span></strong><br /> When sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, related retaliation, or other forms of interpersonal misconduct have been reported, or when otherwise deemed appropriate under the circumstances, the vice president for student affairs and dean of the College, dean of students, Commons deans, JAOs, HROs, Public Safety staff, Title IX Coordinator, or appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue may issue No Contact Orders to the persons involved, whether or not disciplinary action is taken. A No Contact Order is used to restrict encounters and communications between individuals. While a No Contact Order in and of itself does not constitute discipline and will not appear in an employee’s personnel file or on a student’s disciplinary record, refusal to adhere to the order after written or verbal notification of its terms is prohibited and may result in disciplinary action. For more information, see <a href="#NCO">Section 10(F)11, Investigation. </a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">No Trespass Notice</span></strong><br /> A No Trespass Notice prohibits the presence of an individual on Middlebury property, or other properties on which Middlebury programs are occurring. Violating a No Trespass Notice is considered to be a violation of Middlebury policy. As No Trespass Notices are legally enforceable, a violation may lead to arrest and prosecution.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">Relief from Abuse Orders, Orders of Protection and Restraining</span><span style="text-decoration:underline"> Orders</span><br /></strong>In the United States, a relief from abuse order, also called a protection order or restraining order, is a court order that is designed to stop violent, harassing and threatening behavior. It can also stop the respondent from any contact or communication with the complainant, and protect the complainant and the complainant’s family members, as appropriate, from the respondent. Such orders may be awarded by courts in the United States on a temporary basis, in which case they are instituted by a judge immediately and reviewed subsequently through a court hearing process where it is determined whether they will remain in effect for a longer term. Similar resources may exist in the other countries in which Middlebury operates programs.

Confidentiality</h4><p>M<strong></strong><span>iddlebury encourages individuals to report incidents of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking and related retaliation so that they can get the support they need, and so that Middlebury can respond appropriately. Certain Middlebury employees may maintain confidentiality, but most cannot. Although strict confidentiality may therefore not be guaranteed, in all cases Middlebury will handle information in a sensitive manner and will endeavor to protect the privacy of individuals to the extent it can do so consistent with its obligations to respond to reports of sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, stalking and/or related retaliation.</span></p><p>This section is intended to inform students, faculty, staff and covered third parties of the various reporting and confidential disclosure options available to them, so that they can make informed choices about where to go for help. </p><p style="padding-left:30px"><strong>A) <a href="#ACon">Confidential Resources</a></strong><br /><strong>B) <a href="#BCon">Non-Confidential Resources</a></strong><br /><strong>C) <a href="#CCon">Disclosure to Responsible Employees and Request for Confidentiality</a></strong><br /><strong>D) <a href="#DCon">Evaluating Requests for Confidentiality in Sexual Misconduct Cases </a></strong><br /><strong>E) <a href="#ECon">Evaluating Requests for Confidentiality in Domestic and/or Dating Violence, Domestic and/or Dating Misconduct, Stalking and Related Retaliation Cases</a></strong><br /><strong>F) <a href="#FCon">If Confidentiality is Requested but Cannot be Maintained</a></strong><br /><strong>G) <a href="#GCon">When Confidentiality Can be Maintained</a></strong><br /><strong>H) <a href="#HCon">Disclosure During Internal Investigations and Adjudications</a></strong><br /><strong>I) <a href="#ICon">Disclosure Required by Law</a></strong><br /><strong>J) <a href="#JCon">Disclosure to Law Enforcement</a></strong></p><p><strong><a name="ACon" id="ACon"></a>(A) Confidential Resources<br /></strong>Individuals are encouraged to seek support from internal and external resources such as counseling services, advocacy services, and/or chaplains. Contact information is available in <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#AppC">Appendix C</a>.</p><p><strong></strong>A confidential resource is an individual who is legally and ethically bound to keep confidential all information shared with them in the course of providing counsel and support, except under the circumstances noted below. Middlebury respects that the decision to come forward may be difficult and that individuals may wish to seek assistance from someone who can confidentially offer information and support, and who can provide assurances that the disclosed information will not be acted on except in the circumstances outlined below. (For a list of confidential resources, see <a href="#AppC">Appendix C</a>, below.) In general, the law recognizes and protects the confidentiality of communications between a person seeking care and a medical or mental health professional, religious advisor or trained sexual assault advocate. The medical, mental health, and religious professionals and MiddSafe advocates<a href="#EN2">[2]</a> at Middlebury, and their off-campus counterparts, respect and protect confidential communications from students, faculty, and staff to the extent they are legally able to do so. These professionals may have to breach a confidence, however, when they perceive a serious risk of danger or threat to any person or property. In addition, medical and mental health professionals may be required by law to report certain crimes (e.g., any allegation of sexual and/or physical abuse of a person under 18). These exceptions to confidentiality are governed by the law of the state in which the confidential resource is located.</p><p>An individual who speaks to a confidential resource must understand that, if they want to maintain confidentiality, Middlebury will be unable to conduct an investigation into the particular incident or pursue disciplinary action against the respondent. However, confidential resources may assist the individual in receiving other forms of protection and support, such as victim advocacy; academic accommodations; disability, health or mental health services; and changes to living, working, or transportation arrangements. (See <a href="#Services"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 6, Services and Accommodations</span></a> for more information.) An individual who initially requests confidentiality may later decide to file a complaint with Middlebury or report the incident to local law enforcement, and thus have the incident fully investigated. These confidential resources will help to direct the individual to the appropriate resources in the event that the individual wishes to file an internal complaint with Middlebury or report to the police. </p><p><strong><a name="BCon" id="BCon"></a>(B) Non-Confidential Resources<br /></strong>Non-confidential resources are all faculty or staff members, including residential life staff and ombudspersons, who are not medical or counseling professionals, clergy, or MiddSafe Advocates, and are therefore not permitted to honor requests for confidentiality. Non-confidential faculty or staff who learn of an incident of alleged sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation involving a student are required to report that information to a HRO or JAO or the Title IX Coordinator, and they are “responsible employees” to this extent (see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#Reporting">Section 9, Reporting Requirements for Staff and Faculty</a> for more information). The Title IX Coordinator, HROs and JAOs are “responsible employees” for the purposes of redressing reports of sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, stalking and related retaliation in accordance with this policy (see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#AppB">Appendix B</a> for contact information).</p><p>Faculty and staff who are <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/csa">Campus Security Authorities</a> are required to report certain sex offenses and other crimes to the Department of Public Safety for the purpose of compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. For more information about Campus Security Authorities, see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#AppE">Appendix E</a>.</p><p>Employees with supervisory responsibility are expected to report all incidents of alleged sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and misconduct, stalking or related retaliation involving employees to a HRO, the Title IX Coordinator, and/or to Human Resources.</p><p>General inquiries to Middlebury officials about policies or procedures, and conversations in which the respondent is not identified by name or by implication from the circumstances, may remain private. Otherwise, individuals who want to maintain confidentiality should seek a confidential resource.</p><p><strong><a name="CCon" id="CCon"></a>(C)  Disclosure to Responsible Employees and Requests for Confidentiality<br /> </strong>When a responsible employee (e.g., a HRO or JAO) learns of an incident that could constitute sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation involving a student, faculty or staff member or covered third party, the responsible employee will report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator (and/or a HRO or JAO, if a responsible employee other than a HRO/JAO learns of such an incident). The report will include relevant details about the incident of which they are aware, including the names of the parties, any witnesses, and any other relevant facts, including the date, time, and specific location of the alleged incident.</p><p>To the extent possible, information reported to a responsible employee will be shared with others only to the extent necessary to respond to the situation and support the parties and in accordance with state and federal law. Examples include individuals who are responsible for processing, investigating, adjudicating, and responding to sexual misconduct, domestic and dating violence and  misconduct, stalking and/or related retaliation reports; deans; program directors; supervisors; Human Resources staff; and Department of Public Safety or other campus security personnel who are responsible for reporting campus crime statistics and issuing timely warnings under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.</p><p><a name="DCon" id="DCon"></a>(<strong>D) Evaluating Requests for Confidentiality in Sexual Assault Cases </strong><br /> If an individual discloses an incident of sexual assault but wishes to maintain confidentiality (i.e. requests that no investigation into a particular incident be conducted or disciplinary action taken), Middlebury will make every effort to respect this request and will evaluate the request against its responsibility to provide a safe, non-discriminatory environment for all students, faculty and staff, including the individual who reported the sexual assault. Although rare, there are times when Middlebury may not be able to honor the individual’s request. Further, if Middlebury honors the request for confidentiality, Middlebury’s ability to appropriately investigate the incident and pursue disciplinary action against the respondent), if warranted, may be limited.</p><p>Middlebury has designated its JAOs, its HROs, and the Title IX Coordinator as responsible for evaluating requests for confidentiality, as appropriate to the circumstances. In considering an individual’s request for confidentiality, the HROs, JAOs, and/or Title IX Coordinator may consult with Middlebury’s <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/threat/team">Threat Assessment and Management Team</a> (TAM) and other Middlebury personnel, or law enforcement authorities, as appropriate.</p><p>Factors to be considered in determining whether confidentiality should be maintained may include but are not limited to:</p><p>(i) The increased risk that the respondent will commit additional acts of sexual misconduct or other violence, such as:</p><ul><li>whether there have been other sexual misconduct complaints about the same respondent;</li><li>whether the respondent has a history of arrests or records from a prior institution indicating a history of violence;</li><li>whether the respondent has threatened further sexual misconduct or other violence against the individual or others;</li><li>whether the alleged sexual misconduct was committed by multiple respondents;</li><li>circumstances that suggest there is an increased risk of future acts of sexual misconduct or other violence under similar circumstances (e.g., whether the report reveals a pattern of perpetration [e.g., via illicit use of drugs or alcohol] at a given location or by a particular group);</li></ul><p>(ii) whether the alleged sexual misconduct was perpetrated with a weapon;</p><p>(iii) whether the complainant is a minor; and</p><p>(iv) whether Middlebury possesses other means to obtain relevant evidence (e.g., security cameras, information known to Middlebury personnel, or physical evidence).</p><p>The presence of one or more of these factors or other factors as deemed appropriate may prompt an investigation and adjudication under Middlebury’s policies and, if appropriate, result in disciplinary action. If none of these factors is present, Middlebury will likely honor the individual’s request for confidentiality. </p><p><strong><a name="ECon" id="ECon"></a>(E)</strong> <strong>Evaluating Requests for Confidentiality in Sexual Exploitation, Domestic and Dating Violence or Misconduct,  Stalking and Related Retaliation Cases</strong><br /> In cases involving sexual exploitation, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, and/or related retaliation, if an individual insists that their name or other identifiable information not be revealed, or asks that Middlebury not investigate or seek action against the respondent, Middlebury will evaluate the request in the context of its commitment to provide a safe environment for that individual as well as all students, staff and faculty. Thus, Middlebury may weigh the individual’s request against a number of factors, including but not limited to the seriousness of the alleged conduct; circumstances that suggest there is a risk of repeated conduct; whether there have been other reports or complaints about the respondent; the credibility and significance of existing relevant evidence; and the extent of any ongoing threat to the individual, the Middlebury community or any of its members.</p><p>In considering an individual’s request for confidentiality, the HROs, JAOs, and/or Title IX Coordinator may consult with Middlebury’s <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/threat/team">Threat Assessment and Management Team</a> and other Middlebury personnel, or law enforcement authorities, as appropriate.</p><p><strong><a name="FCon" id="FCon"></a>(F) If Confidentiality is Requested but Cannot be Maintained</strong><br /> If Middlebury determines that it cannot maintain an individual’s request for confidentiality, Middlebury will inform the individual prior to conducting an investigation (unless extenuating circumstances are present) and will, to the extent possible, only share information with those individuals who are responsible for Middlebury’s response to the incident. Middlebury will not require the individual to participate in any investigation or disciplinary proceeding, nor will it require the individual to personally report any information to law enforcement authorities. It will remain up to the individual to choose whether they personally want to participate in notifying law enforcement authorities, or would rather not do so. See <a href="#JCon">Section 3(J), Disclosure to Law Enforcement</a>, below, for more information.   </p><p>If when responding to reports of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, or related retaliation, Middlebury determines it is obligated to take any action that would involve disclosing a reporting individual’s identity to the respondent, or an action from which the reporting individual’s identity may be easily determined by the respondent, the individual will be informed before the action is taken (unless extenuating circumstances are present). If the reporting individual requests that the respondent be informed that they requested that there be no investigation or disciplinary action, Middlebury will endeavor to honor this request and inform the respondent that Middlebury made the decision to investigate the matter.</p><p>Middlebury will take supportive measures when requested and reasonably available that are designed to prevent and address retaliation against individuals whose requests for confidentiality have not been honored (see <a href="#Retaliation">Section 4, Retaliation,</a> below), and to respond to their needs for support, services and accommodations (See <a href="#Services">Section 6, Services and Accommodations,</a> below).  </p><p><strong><a name="GCon" id="GCon"></a>(G) When Confidentiality Can be Maintained</strong><br /> If Middlebury determines that it can respect the individual’s request for confidentiality (i.e., the individual's request that a report of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, or related retaliation not be investigated/adjudicated), Middlebury will take action to assist the individual, to the extent possible, including the measures identified in <a href="#Services">Section 6, Services and Accommodations</a>, where such measures are requested and reasonably available.</p><p>As noted in <a href="#DCon">Section 3(D), above,</a> individuals should be aware that if Middlebury honors their request for confidentiality, this may limit Middlebury’s ability to fully respond to the incident, including pursuing disciplinary action against the respondent.</p><p><a name="HCon" id="HCon"></a>(<strong>H) Disclosure During Internal Investigations and Adjudications<br /> </strong>Middlebury will handle information related to alleged violations of this policy with sensitivity and discretion. However, Middlebury may need to disclose information relating to an incident (including the identity of parties, witnesses or others) to the extent necessary to conduct a thorough, fair, and impartial investigation and adjudication process for all involved parties.</p><p><strong><a name="ICon" id="ICon"></a>(I) Disclosure Required by Law</strong><br /> Middlebury will not include the names of complainants or other personally identifying information in publicly available reports that are compiled as required by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, and when issuing timely warnings as required by the Clery Act, will withhold as confidential the names of such individuals. Middlebury officials responsible for compiling publicly available recordkeeping such as crime statistics published in the Annual Security Report(s), daily crime logs or timely warnings, review reports before publication and distribution to ensure that the information does not contain the names of complainants or other personally identifying information. Statistics published in Middlebury’s Annual Security Report(s) contain only the number and type of reported crimes. Middlebury is also part of a larger community and context. If there is an independent investigation, lawsuit, or criminal proceeding related to a sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation matter, those involved or others may be required by law to provide testimony or documents (e.g., investigation reports, witness statements, and any other information gathered or obtained in the course of a particular matter).</p><p><strong><a name="JCon" id="JCon"></a>(J) Disclosure to Law Enforcement</strong><br /> In certain circumstances, Middlebury may need to report an incident to law enforcement authorities. Such circumstances include but are not limited to incidents that warrant the undertaking of safety and security measures for the protection of the individual and/or the campus community, or situations in which there is clear and imminent danger and/or a weapon may be involved. Complainants may choose to notify authorities personally and directly with or without Middlebury’s assistance, or may choose not to notify such authorities personally; for more information, see <a href="#Criminal">Section 7, Pursuing a Criminal Complaint,</a> below.  </p><h4><strong><a name="Retaliation" id="Retaliation"></a>4. Retaliation</strong></h4><p>Retaliating directly or indirectly against a person because they have made a report or complaint with Middlebury, and/or an outside agency, or because they participated in an investigation is prohibited. Retaliation includes but is not limited to ostracizing the person, pressuring the person to drop or not support the complaint or to provide false or misleading information, engaging in conduct that may reasonably be perceived to affect adversely that person's educational, living, or work environment, threatening, intimidating or coercing the person, or otherwise discriminating against any person for exercising their rights or responsibilities under this policy. Depending on the circumstances, retaliation may also be unlawful. Retaliation under this policy may be found whether or not the underlying complaint is ultimately found to have merit. Complaints of retaliation should be reported under the procedures described below.</p><h4><strong><a name="Emergencies" id="Emergencies"></a>5. Emergencies</strong></h4><p>If the safety of any individual is an immediate concern, involved parties or observers in the United States should contact local law enforcement by <strong>dialing 911</strong>. Involved parties or observers in other countries should notify local law enforcement and their program director.</p><p>Individuals participating in Middlebury’s programs should also report incidents of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking and related retaliation to the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety">Department of Public Safety</a> (Vermont programs), the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/study-abroad/health/assault">safety contacts for individual schools abroad </a>(Middlebury schools and programs abroad), or other campus security personnel applicable to the program at issue (see contact information in <a href="#AppB">Appendix B</a>, below). </p><p>Middlebury’s <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety">Department of Public Safety </a>(or other campus safety personnel for programs outside of Vermont, as applicable) will coordinate its response to the report with other officials, as appropriate (including the HROs, the JAOs, the Title IX Coordinator, and responsible <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/threat/team">Threat Assessment and Management Team</a>) and, if necessary, law enforcement, to intervene at the earliest practical point to stop the behavior and coordinate services to the complainant. A coordinated response will include consideration of the complainant’s request for confidentiality in accordance with <a href="#confidentiality">Section 3, Confidentiality</a>, above and may also include the implementation of safety measures as deemed necessary; see <a href="#Services"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 6, Services and Accommodations</span></a> below for examples.</p><h4><strong><a name="Services" id="Services"></a>6. Services and Accommodations   </strong></h4><p>It is not necessary to file a complaint with Middlebury, participate in an adjudication process, or file a criminal complaint in order to request services or accommodations from Middlebury. These may include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>No Contact Orders restricting encounters and communications between the parties (see <a href="#Definitions">Section 2, Definitions</a>);</li><li>No Trespass Notices prohibiting the presence of an individual on Middlebury property, and/or other properties on which Middlebury programs are occurring (see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#Definitions">Section 2, Definitions</a>);</li><li>Academic accommodations, including but not limited to deadline extensions, incompletes, course changes or late drops, or other arrangements as appropriate (see the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/academics/Course_Registration_and_Conduct_of_Courses">Academics: Course Registration and Conduct of Courses</a> and <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/academics/Grades_and_Records">Grades and Transcripts</a> sections of the Handbook for more information);</li><li>Residential accommodations, including but not limited to arranging for new housing, or providing temporary housing options, as appropriate;</li><li>Changing transportation or working arrangements or providing other employment accommodations, as appropriate;</li><li>Assisting the individual in accessing support services, including, as available, victim advocacy, academic support, counseling, disability, health or mental health services, visa and immigration assistance, student financial aid services, and legal assistance both on and off campus, as applicable (see <a href="#AppC">Appendix C </a>for a list of resources);</li><li>Informing the individual of the right to report a crime to local law enforcement and/or seek orders of protection, restraining orders, or relief from abuse orders from United States courts or courts outside of the United States as applicable, and providing assistance if the individual wishes to do so. Middlebury will also work with complainants and others as appropriate to respect and implement the requirements of such orders on premises that it owns or controls, as necessary and appropriate.</li></ul><p>Where a complainant reportedly subjected to sexual assault, domestic or dating violence or stalking makes a reasonable request for accommodations like those described above, Middlebury is obligated to comply with that request if such accommodations are reasonably available.</p><p>Students and employees seeking services, protective measures, and/or accommodations should direct their request to a Commons dean, program director, HRO, JAO, or the Title IX coordinator, as appropriate. The request will be evaluated and responded to by the Commons dean, program director, HRO, JAO or Title IX coordinator after consultation, as needed, with the appropriate authority or authorities for the school or program at issue. Factors to be considered in determining reasonable services or accommodations may include the following:</p><ul><li>the specific need expressed by the complainant;</li><li>the severity and/or pervasiveness of the allegations;</li><li>any continuing effects on the complainant;</li><li>whether the complainant and the respondent share the same residence hall, dining hall, class, extracurricular activities, transportation or job location; and</li><li>whether other judicial measures have been taken to protect the complainant.</li></ul><p>Middlebury will maintain as confidential any services, accommodations or protective measures provided to complainants, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of Middlebury to provide the services, accommodations or protective measures. As such, Middlebury may need to disclose some information about the individual to a third party to provide the necessary accommodations or protective measures in a timely manner. The following individuals are typically responsible for determining what information should be disclosed and to whom it should be disclosed: a JAO, a HRO, Title IX Coordinator, Commons dean, Public Safety officer or program director. The decision to disclose information will be made after careful consideration of possible alternatives to disclosure and/or limiting the information provided to the third party as much as possible without compromising Middlebury’s ability to provide the services, accommodations or protective measures.</p><h4><strong><a name="Criminal" id="Criminal"></a>7. Pursuing a Criminal Complaint, Involvement of Law Enforcement, and Obtaining a No Contact Order, No Trespass Notice, or Order of Protection<br /> </strong></h4><p>In addition to (or instead of) utilizing Middlebury’s processes and resources, any student, employee or covered third party who wishes to report a complaint of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, or stalking under this policy may also pursue criminal charges with local, state, or federal law enforcement agencies (see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#AppB">Appendix B</a> for contact information). Middlebury will offer and upon request provide assistance to students, employees and covered third parties with notifying law enforcement agencies. These options are available regardless of whether an individual chooses to file a complaint with Middlebury. Individuals have the option to notify such agencies with or without assistance from Middlebury, and have the option not to personally notify such authorities.</p><p>As noted in <a href="#Definitions">2. Definitions</a> and in <a href="#Services">6. Services and Accommodations</a>, Middlebury can issue No Contact Orders restricting contact between two members of the Middlebury community, and No Trespass Notices restricting individuals from Middlebury-owned or rented property. Requests for a No Contact Order or a No Trespass Notice may be directed by telephone, email or in person to a JAO, a HRO, the Title IX Coordinator or program director (see contact information in <a href="#AppB">Appendix B</a>, below).</p><p>Middlebury does not have the authority to issue Relief From Abuse Orders, Orders of Protection or Restraining Orders (see <a href="#Definitions">2. Definitions</a>), as these are granted by the court system. In addition to (or instead of) Middlebury’s No Contact Orders and No Trespass Notices, individuals who are being or who may have been subjected to sexual assault, domestic or dating violence, stalking and/or related retaliation may pursue Orders of Protection<a href="#_msocom_2" name="_msoanchor_2" id="_msoanchor_2"></a>, Restraining Orders and/or Relief from Abuse Orders from United States courts or courts outside of the United States as applicable. Middlebury will support individuals if they request Middlebury’s assistance with making contact with law enforcement authorities and other external resources to seek such orders. Middlebury will comply with and respect such orders to the extent applicable.</p><p>Requests for assistance with contacting law enforcement authorities or obtaining an Order of Protection, a Relief from Abuse Order, a Restraining Order or other lawful order may be made in person, or via email, phone or teleconference to a JAO, HRO, Title IX Coordinator, Public Safety staff member or program director. For additional information regarding making reports to the police and/or obtaining an Order of Protection, Restraining Order, or Relief from Abuse Order, see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October/working-copy-2/October#AppC">Appendix C</a> below.</p><h4><a name="Medical" id="Medical"></a><strong>8. Medical Care and Evidence Preservation</strong></h4><p>Any individual who may be experiencing or has experienced sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation is encouraged to immediately seek any necessary medical care and to seek help from appropriate Middlebury, law enforcement and/or medical personnel, even if the individual is uncertain about whether to ultimately pursue a complaint or criminal charges, or to seek an Order of Protection (see <a href="#AppC">Appendix C, Resources, </a>below). It is important for individuals to preserve all possible evidence in case they decide at some point to do so. This evidence may assist in proving whether the alleged criminal conduct (or a policy violation) occurred and/or it may be helpful in obtaining a protective order. Therefore, if at all possible, individuals should refrain from changing clothes, showering or otherwise changing their physical state after an incident, until after consulting with medical personnel about how to best preserve evidence. They should also preserve any available physical evidence, documents, or electronic evidence (such as, for example, text messages, photographs, social media posts, etc.).</p><h4><strong><a name="Reporting" id="Reporting"></a>9. Reporting Requirements for Staff and Faculty </strong></h4><p>Any staff or faculty member who learns of an incident of alleged sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation involving a student or covered third party must report this information to Middlebury’s Title IX Coordinator, a HRO, or a JAO (see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#AppB">Appendix B</a> for contact information) or the appropriate program director in cases involving the Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf, the Institute, or other Middlebury programs as applicable, unless their status as a confidential resource precludes this disclosure. Confidential resources include the staff of the Parton Center for Health and Wellness, the staff of the Chaplain’s Office, MiddSafe Advocates, or other medical, counseling, support or religious personnel and volunteers who are required by law to maintain confidentiality; please see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#confidentiality">Section 3, Confidentiality</a> for more information.</p><p>Employees with supervisory responsibility are expected to report all incidents of alleged sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation involving employees to the Title IX Coordinator, a HRO, and/or to Human Resources.</p><h4><strong><a name="Investigation" id="Investigation"></a>10.

See <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#Criminal">Section 7, Pursuing a Criminal Complaint</a>, and contact information in <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#AppB">Appendix B.</a><span style="text-decoration:underline"> </span></p><p>Middlebury will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or proceeding to begin its own investigation and resolve complaints under this policy. Middlebury will, however, comply with valid law enforcement requests in a criminal investigation. As such, Middlebury may need to delay temporarily an investigation under this policy while law enforcement is in the process of gathering evidence. Once law enforcement has completed its gathering of evidence, Middlebury will promptly resume and complete its investigation. Middlebury may also take interim measures to promote the safety and well-being of the complainant and the school community while law enforcement is gathering evidence.  </p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><a name="ComplaintsDirected" id="ComplaintsDirected"></a>(B) Complaints Directed to HROs or JAOs</strong></span></p><p>In addition to the mandatory reporting requirements in <a href="#Reporting">Section 9, Reporting Requirements for Staff and Faculty</a>, above, any Middlebury student, faculty member, staff member or covered third party who has reasonable cause to believe that sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking and/or related retaliation has occurred or is occurring should report this information to the immediate attention of any of the following individuals: a HRO designated for the Middlebury program at issue; a JAO; and/or the Title IX Coordinator.

Concerns of this nature about the investigator should be shared with the JAO/HRO; concerns about the JAO or HRO should be shared with the Title IX coordinator; and concerns about the Title IX coordinator should be shared with the vice president for Human Resources and Risk. The official with whom the concern is shared will consider the concern and inform the parties of a decision as to whether any related action is appropriate and whether an alternate will be appointed.

Therefore, to encourage reporting, Middlebury may, where appropriate, offer leniency with respect to other policy violations that may be revealed as a result of a report, particularly those involving underage drinking or drug use. The nature and scope of the leniency will depend on the particular circumstances involved. The Title IX Coordinator, HRO, JAO and/or other supervisory authority, as appropriate (in the case of faculty or staff), will have sole discretion in determining the appropriate course of action. Individuals should understand that the use of alcohol or drugs never makes them at fault for sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, and/or related retaliation committed against them, nor does it mitigate accountability for committing these prohibited behaviors against another.</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="InvestigationOverview" id="InvestigationOverview"></a>(E) Investigation Overview</span></strong></p><p>1. The HRO/JAO will provide a copy of this policy to the complainant and respondent, and will inform both parties in writing that Middlebury is investigating and adjudicating the possibility that the respondent may have committed sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking and/or related retaliation. The parties will also be given notice of any additional possible policy violations being investigated and adjudicated in relation to the incident.</p><p>2. Should a respondent who has been notified of an investigation/adjudication fail to cooperate with the investigator, the investigation may proceed, a finding may be reached, and a sanction may be imposed based on the information available.</p><p>3. A No Contact Order is normally issued to restrict contact and communication between the complainant and respondent for the duration of the investigation. When the totality of the circumstances suggest additional measures are appropriate, temporary removal of a student or employee from campus, a No Trespass Notice, or any other interim measures deemed necessary for the protection of the parties or third parties may be initiated by Middlebury at any time.</p><p>4. Middlebury may choose to discontinue an investigation at any time. The complainant may request that an investigation be discontinued at any time. Middlebury will attempt to honor the wishes of the complainant. However, to accommodate cases where compelling evidence suggests significant individual or community safety concerns, the decision to discontinue an investigation is within the sole discretion of Middlebury. Please see <a href="#confidentiality">Section 3(D),(E), Confidentiality, </a>for a review of the factors to be considered in determining whether to pursue an investigation.</p><p>5. To the extent permitted by law, the complainant and respondent will be afforded the same rights and opportunities throughout the investigation and adjudication process, including the opportunity to recommend witnesses and submit evidence. However, investigation logistics, including but not limited to the sequence of interviews, the decision to interview particular witnesses, and the decision to allow or consider evidence offered by the parties, are within the discretion of the HRO and/or investigator.</p><p>6. Complainants and respondents are entitled to the same opportunities to have an advisor of their choice present at any interviews, meetings or proceedings that they are attending related to the investigation and adjudication process under this policy. The advisor may advise the complainant or respondent privately, but cannot act as a speaking advocate at a meeting. An investigator or other Middlebury representative may terminate meetings, remove or dismiss advisors, and/or proceed with the investigation or adjudication based on otherwise-available information if an advisor is disruptive or otherwise refuses to comply with the requirements of this policy.</p><p>Advisors who are not otherwise designated and serving as confidential resources (see <a href="#confidentiality">Section 3(A), Confidentiality</a>) are not confidential resources for the purpose of this investigation. Advisors may not discuss or disclose the content of any meetings or procedures related to the investigation and adjudication process other than with the party they are supporting, the investigator, the JAO, and/or the HRO, unless they reasonably believe that disclosing such information to a law enforcement agency is necessary to lessen or avoid a substantial and imminent risk of physical harm to any person, or they are otherwise required by law to do so. Similarly, advisors are strictly precluded from copying, sharing, describing, and/or otherwise disseminating any investigation- or adjudication-related materials to which they are privy, and they shall not disclose the contents of these materials to other parties, except under those limited conditions noted above. </p><p>While each party may have an advisor of choice, they may not compel any specific person to serve as their advisor. Middlebury’s faculty and/or staff may be available to serve as advisors, but none are required to do so.</p><p><a name="E7" id="E7"></a>7. To protect the integrity of the investigation, complainants, respondents, witnesses, affected parties and advisors shall not disclose any information discussed or revealed during the investigation while the investigation and adjudication process is still pending, other than to the investigator, JAO, HRO, and/or a confidential resource such as their mental health counselor or attorney (who also must not disclose such information), except if they reasonably believe that disclosing such information to a law enforcement agency is necessary to lessen or avoid a substantial and imminent risk of physical harm to any person, or they are otherwise required by law to do so. It is also critical that all involved parties and their advisors and supporters adhere to the retaliation prohibition included in this policy; see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#Retaliation">Section 4, Retaliation</a><span style="text-decoration:underline">,</span> for more information. Complainants and respondents are advised to discuss any questions or concerns they have about these issues with the JAO.</p><p>After Middlebury's investigation and adjudication process has concluded, complainants, respondents, witnesses, affected parties and advisors are prohibited from disclosing, describing, or publishing any and all documents Middlebury provided during the investigative and/or adjudicative process, unless the disclosure is required or expressly permitted by law or applicable guidance. While this provision prohibits dissemination of Middlebury's investigation materials and information an individual learns from these materials, it does not prohibit the sharing of information about which individuals have independent knowledge as long as they do not engage in <a href="#Retaliation">retaliation</a> as defined by this policy or violate any other Middlebury policies.</p><p>In accordance with applicable law and/or federal guidance, a complainant is not prohibited from sharing the results of a case involving a report of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence or stalking.  The results of a case consist of the name of the respondent, any violation found to have been committed, and any sanction imposed against the respondent by Middlebury.</p><p>8. All materials collected and generated in the course of an investigation are the property of Middlebury. Complainants, respondents, witnesses, affected parties and advisors may not record interviews or administrative meetings associated with the investigation and adjudication process.</p><p>9. This policy is regularly reviewed and updated. The policy provided in Middlebury’s Web-based Handbook will always reflect Middlebury’s most current policy. When an incident under investigation occurred while a previous version of the policy was in effect, the definitions of prohibited behaviors at the time of the incident in question will be applied to the conduct under investigation. However, the policy and procedures in effect at the time the investigation is initiated will govern all other aspects of the investigation and adjudication process, unless otherwise required by law.  </p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="Investigationsubsection" id="Investigationsubsection"></a>(F) Investigation</span></strong></p><p>1. If it is determined that an investigation and adjudication should proceed under this policy, an investigator will be appointed to conduct an investigation that is appropriate under the circumstances, and is prompt, thorough, fair, equitable, objective and impartial. The investigator may consult with the HRO, and others as appropriate, on the strategic direction of the investigation and the preparation of investigation materials.</p><p>2. Middlebury’s investigation and adjudication process does not require or permit the complainant and respondent to interact or communicate directly or indirectly with each other concerning the process or the matter under investigation at any time. The parties are therefore not permitted to question or cross-examine each other during the course of the investigation. See <a href="#InvestigationOverview">Section 10, Investigation Overview</a>, for more information.</p><p>3. The investigator is authorized to contact any and all individuals with potentially relevant information. Middlebury recognizes, however, that individuals who are bound by legal privileges may not be able to disclose privileged information, unless an exception applies. The investigator is authorized to access relevant records, except those legally protected as confidential or privileged, and may collect any additional evidence relevant to the complaint. The nature and scope of the investigation is within the discretion of the investigator and/or the HRO.</p><p><a name="crossexam" id="crossexam"></a>4. The complainant and respondent will be asked to identify, preserve and submit all evidence pertaining to the matter under investigation, and to identify witnesses they believe may have relevant testimony to share. The investigator is not required to consider the evidence submitted or interview any particular witness, even if identified by one of the parties. However, in determining whether to interview witnesses or review evidence, the investigator should consider such factors as equity, fairness, thoroughness, and impartial treatment of both parties.</p><p>5. All participants in the investigation are expected to cooperate fully by providing complete, accurate, and truthful information. They may also be expected to sign statements or other documents memorializing the information they provided, and may be asked to keep the substance of the interview confidential. Failure to cooperate fully with the investigator may subject the individual to the full range of disciplinary actions, as applicable. </p><p>6. Rules of evidence applicable in court proceedings do not apply in this process. The evidentiary materials may include information generated or gathered that the investigator and/or HRO ultimately deem immaterial. Both parties are invited to comment on the relevance, weight and substance of the evidentiary materials during their individual meetings with the HRO and in their written responses to the investigator's report. The evaluation of evidence by the investigator and the HRO includes consideration of its relevance, materiality, and credibility. In cases where an evidentiary or procedural question arises in connection with the investigation or adjudication process, the HRO will make a determination, either independently or in consultation with the Title IX Coordinator or other Middlebury official as appropriate.</p><p>7. When the investigator determines that sufficient information has been collected to allow the investigator to make a recommended finding, the complainant and respondent may review the witness statements and other evidentiary materials.</p><p>Although each party may share access to the contents of the investigation materials with an advisor of choice, all parties and advisors must adhere to the confidentiality requirements in <a href="#E7">Section 10(E) 6,7, and 8</a>.</p><p>8.  After reviewing the investigation materials, each party may have an individual meeting with the HRO, who is responsible for making the official determination as to whether any Middlebury policy under investigation has been violated. This meeting is intended to allow the parties to meet the HRO, and to have a reasonable opportunity to comment on the content of the evidentiary materials. If either party wishes to submit new evidentiary material, they may do so prior to the HRO meeting. The meeting will be audio recorded, and the investigator may be present. The HRO meetings will normally be scheduled at least seven days after access to the initial evidentiary materials has been provided to the parties. The HRO has the sole discretion to direct the parties to focus on relevant issues and/or limit redundancies, and to determine the overall length of the meeting. </p><p>If it is deemed that any evidence has emerged at this stage that warrants further inquiry, the investigator will pursue additional investigation. Both parties will be provided with access to any new evidentiary materials collected or generated at this stage, including the transcriptions of the HRO meetings, prior to the official determination.</p><p>9. Each party may submit one character reference letter no later than seven days from the day the parties have been provided with access to the initial investigation materials. The person providing the character reference is invited to introduce the party to the investigator and to the HRO outside of the context of the incident in question. The person providing the reference is not permitted to offer testimony or commentary related to the incident in question, or to include that person’s assessment of the case or the party’s role in it in any way.</p><p>10. After considering the parties’ responses to the evidentiary materials and their character references and completing any additional investigation deemed appropriate, the investigator will prepare a report for the HRO. The report will include the investigator’s recommended finding of whether the policy or policies under investigation has/have been violated, and the investigator’s rationale. The investigator's recommendation will be based on the preponderance of evidence standard, i.e., whether it is more likely than not that the policy was violated. While the investigator may consult with the HRO and others as appropriate regarding the preparation of the report, the recommended findings are within the discretion of the investigator. The HRO will have access to all investigation materials, including character references.</p><p>11. The JAO will provide both parties with access to the investigator’s report, and to any additional materials collected or generated after the initial investigation materials were shared with the parties, prior to the HRO’s issuance of a determination. Each party may submit a written response within seven days of receipt of access to these materials. The JAO/HRO may extend this deadline if warranted by the circumstances; see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#Time">Section 10(I), Time Frames</a>, below, for more information. Each party may request access to the other party’s written statement after both statements have been received by the JAO and the deadline has passed.</p><p>12. If at any point prior to the issuance of an official determination new relevant evidence that will be used during the proceeding is identified, it will be shared with the complainant and respondent, who will have an opportunity to submit a written response within a time frame determined by the HRO/JAO. The written responses, if submitted, will be shared with and considered by the HRO prior to the HRO’s issuance of an official determination. The HRO may move forward with a determination or may direct the investigator to pursue an additional investigation and supplement their report. If the report is supplemented the parties will have access to the report and any additional evidence and will have an opportunity to submit a written response by a deadline established by the HRO/JAO.</p><p><a name="NCO" id="NCO"></a>13. If one party alleges that another party violated a No Contact Order (NCO) or No Trespass Notice (NTN) when the allegations can be evaluated during an ongoing SMDVS investigation/adjudication or after the SMDVS investigation/adjudication process has been completed, the HRO or HRO’s designee will determine how to proceed. If the HRO does not assume jurisdiction, the allegations may be addressed through Middlebury's conduct process for the appropriate school or program, or through the appropriate employment process. Alternatively, the HRO may designate an appropriate Middlebury official(s) to oversee and/or conduct an investigation and adjudicate the matter. This process will include, at minimum, an opportunity for the parties to review and respond to the evidence prior to a determination, and will utilize the "preponderance of the evidence" standard. If a violation of a NCO or NTO is found, the matter will be referred to the appropriate supervisory authority for discipline and/or other appropriate action in accordance with existing handbook policies. </p><p>If the HRO assumes jurisdiction over the allegations and deems an investigation to be necessary, the HRO will determine the scope, process, and timeline of the NCO/NTN investigation and adjudication, which may not necessarily follow the procedures outlined in this SMDVS policy, if the HRO determines that using other procedures is more appropriate. The HRO has the discretion to determine whether an advisor of choice may be present at any processes or meetings related to an NCO/NTN investigation, depending on the circumstances. Both parties will have an opportunity to review and respond to all evidence relevant to the NCO/NTN investigation according to a timeline established by the HRO. The HRO will make a finding and will refer the matter to the appropriate sanctioning authority if a violation is found. Any information resulting from a concurrent NCO/NTN investigation may be considered in the determination of a finding and/or the assignment of a sanction in the SMDVS matter as appropriate. Should the HRO determine that an NCO/NTN violation may also constitute retaliation, the parties will be notified in writing that retaliation will be added to the policies under consideration in the SMDVS investigation.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><a name="Determination" id="Determination"></a>(G) Determination<br /></strong></span></p><p>1. The HRO is responsible for making the determination of whether any Middlebury policy under investigation has been violated. The HRO is not bound by the investigator’s report; rather, it is advisory to the HRO. The HRO may accept or reject the investigator’s recommended finding in whole or in part, and may request additional relevant information before making a determination. The HRO may consult with the investigator and/or other persons as determined appropriate in the discretion of the HRO. The HRO will avoid duplicating the efforts of the investigator, as well as accepting the investigator’s recommended finding without careful review of all of the evidence.</p><p>2. After a review of all evidence, the investigator’s report and recommended finding, and the parties' written responses and character references, the HRO will issue a determination, in writing, as to whether the allegations that sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, related retaliation, and/or any additional prohibited behaviors being investigated, are proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The determination will contain an explanation of the rationale for the determination, including (1) how the evidence and information presented during the investigation and adjudication process was weighed; (2) how the standard of evidence was applied; and (3) how the evidence and information support the determination.</p><p>The complainant and respondent will be simultaneously informed, in writing, (a) of the HRO's determination (that is, the result of the proceeding and the rationale); (b) of Middlebury's procedures for complainants and respondents to appeal the HRO's determination and/or actions imposed, if applicable; (c) of any change to the results of the disciplinary process that occurs prior to the time that such results become final; and (d) when such results become final.</p><p>3. If the respondent is a <strong>faculty member</strong>, both parties will be notified of the HRO’s determination in writing, to the extent permitted by law. Both parties in Middlebury College faculty-respondent cases may appeal the finding at this point, based on the grounds and following the procedures described in <a href="#Appeals"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Section 10(J), Appeals</span></a>.  For Middlebury College faculty members, the sanctioning process will remain in abeyance until any appeals of the HRO’s determination are complete. </p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><a name="Sanction" id="Sanction"></a>(H) Sanction</strong></span></p><p>1. If the HRO finds that the respondent engaged in behavior that violates this policy (or other Middlebury policies under investigation, as applicable), the JAO will, in accordance with sections 3, 4 and 5 below, forward the case to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue, who will assign a sanction or sanctions, and other actions as appropriate. In determining the sanction or sanctions and/or other actions, the administrator will be guided by a number of considerations, including but not limited to the following:</p><ul><li>The severity, persistence or pervasiveness of the prohibited conduct;</li><li>The nature of the prohibited conduct;</li><li>The impact of the prohibited conduct on the complainant;</li><li>The impact or implications of the prohibited conduct within the Middlebury community;</li><li>Prior misconduct by the respondent, including the respondent’s relevant prior conduct history, at Middlebury or elsewhere;</li><li>Whether the respondent has accepted responsibility for the prohibited conduct;</li><li>The maintenance of a safe, nondiscriminatory and respectful environment conducive to living, learning, and working; and</li><li>Any other mitigating, aggravating, or compelling factors.</li></ul><p>As noted below, when a student respondent is found responsible for sexual assault, suspension or expulsion are the likely outcomes.</p><p>2. If appeal rights exist, sanctions and other actions will go into effect at the expiration of the deadline for the submission of an appeal, if no appeal is submitted, or at the conclusion of the appeal process if applicable. If appeal rights do not exist, sanctions and other actions will go into effect immediately. This language does not preclude the possibility of emergency action as needed; please see <a href="#Emergency">Section 13, Emergency Withdrawal, Suspension or Expulsion</a>.</p><p>3. If the HRO finds that a <strong>student</strong> has engaged in conduct that violates this policy (or other Middlebury policies under investigation), each party may submit to the JAO a Sanction Statement sharing any thoughts they would like the appropriate authority to consider when assigning a sanction. The JAO will then provide the case materials, including the Sanction Statements, to the appropriate supervisory authority or authorities (e.g., dean of the Language Schools, dean of the Center for Advising and Career Services and Student Services at the Institute [“Dean of CACS and Student Services”], director of the Bread Loaf School of English, director of the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference, director of the School of the Environment, VPAA/dean of Schools, vice president for Student Affairs/dean of the College, etc.). The JAO will also provide the Sanction Statements to the HRO, who after reviewing them will make a sanction recommendation to the appropriate supervisory authority or authorities. When multiple supervisory authorities are involved in assigning sanctions, they may collaborate with each other as appropriate.</p><p>After a review of the HRO’s recommendation, the supervisory authority may impose disciplinary and/or other appropriate action. Prior conduct may be taken into account in the assignment of these actions.</p><p>Detailed information about disciplinary sanctions and their correspondence with conduct prohibited under this policy, can be found in <a href="#AppF">Appendix F, Sanctions</a>. For a finding of sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, or related retaliation, sanctions could include written reprimands, probationary status, letters of official discipline, suspension or expulsion from any or all Middlebury program(s) in which the student is enrolled or participating. Although sanctions for violation(s) of this policy can include any form of discipline as stated in this section, students found to have committed sexual assault will most likely receive a sanction of suspension or expulsion.  Middlebury may also take other non-disciplinary action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (e.g., remedies applied to the respondent to address the needs of the complainant, including but not limited to room changes, class changes, building restrictions, extracurricular activity restrictions, modification of No Contact Orders to favor the complainant, and other actions to preserve the rights of the complainant to a safe environment). Middlebury may also provide notice of the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority of any Middlebury program in which the respondent intends to participate, who may consider this information in determining the respondent's admission to the program and/or other program participation parameters, as appropriate. Notification of a finding of responsibility, sanction, or other action under this policy may also be provided to the home institution of non-Middlebury undergraduate and graduate students or any other program in which the student is enrolled or to which the student is pursuing enrollment.</p><p>If the conduct occurred during the course and scope of the student’s employment at Middlebury, the matter will be referred jointly to the Human Resources Department and the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue, as applicable, for disciplinary sanctions that may include written reprimands, or termination of employment, and/or written reprimands, probationary status, letters of official discipline, suspension, or expulsion from Middlebury, or other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Additional non-disciplinary outcomes, such as training or extending and modifying mutual No Contact Orders, may also be imposed regardless of the finding.</p><p>4. If the HRO finds that a <strong>staff member</strong> has engaged in conduct that violates this policy (or other Middlebury policies under investigation, if applicable), each party may submit to the JAO a Sanction Statement sharing any thoughts they would like to have considered in the determination of a sanction.  The JAO will then provide the case materials, including the Sanction Statements, to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (e.g., the Middlebury College Human Resources Department, or the Institute’s Human Resources Department, as applicable). The JAO will also provide the Sanction Statements to the HRO, who after reviewing them will make a sanction recommendation to the appropriate supervisory authority. After review of the HRO’s recommendation, the supervisory authority will initiate procedures to determine and impose appropriate disciplinary action. Disciplinary sanctions for a finding of sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, or related retaliation may include written reprimands, or termination of employment. Although sanctions for violations of this policy can include any form of discipline as stated in this section, staff found to have committed sexual assault will most likely receive a sanction of termination of employment. Middlebury may also take other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (e.g., remedies applied to the respondent to address the needs of the complainant and/or the community, including but not limited to building restrictions, reassignment of work duties, training, modification of No Contact Orders to favor the complainant, and other actions to preserve the rights of the complainant and the community to a safe environment). </p><p>5. If the HRO finds that a <strong>faculty member</strong> has engaged in conduct that violates this policy, or other Middlebury policies under investigation, if applicable (absent or following an appeal of that finding in accordance with paragraph G3, above, if an appeal was granted), each party may submit to the JAO a Sanction Statement sharing any thoughts they would like to have considered in the determination of a sanction.  The JAO will then provide the case materials, including the Sanction Statements, to the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue (e.g., the Middlebury College VPAA/Dean of Faculty, the Institute’s VPAA/Dean of the Institute, dean of the Language Schools, or the VPAA/dean of Schools). The JAO will also provide the Sanction Statements to the HRO, who after reviewing them will make a sanction recommendation to the appropriate supervisory authority. Sanctioning and appeals for faculty whose primary appointment is with the undergraduate college will follow the procedures for Middlebury College faculty, regardless of the program for which the individual was employed at the time of the incident.  </p><p>After review of the HRO’s recommendation, the supervisory authority will initiate procedures to determine and impose appropriate disciplinary action according to the procedures in existing Faculty Handbook policies and/or contracts, as applicable. Disciplinary sanctions may include written reprimands, salary freeze, or termination of employment. Middlebury may also take other action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (including but not limited to remedies applied to the respondent to address the needs of the complainant and/or the community, including but not limited to building restrictions, reassignment of classes or other work duties, training, modification of No Contact Orders to favor the complainant, and other actions to preserve the rights of the complainant and the community to a safe environment). </p><p>6. The complainant and respondent will be simultaneously informed, in writing, of (a) any disciplinary or other action arising out of an allegation of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking, related retaliation or any other alleged policy violation that was investigated and adjudicated under this policy, and the rationale for the disciplinary and/or other action; (b) Middlebury’s procedures for complainants and respondents to appeal the HRO’s decision and/or discipline and/or actions imposed, if applicable; (c) any change to the results of a disciplinary process that occurs prior to the time that such results become final; and (d) when such results become final.</p><p>In explaining the rationale for the result, the supervisory authority will indicate: (1) how the evidence and information presented during the investigation and adjudication process was weighed; (2) how the standard of evidence was applied; and (3) how the evidence and information support the sanction determination.</p><p>7. Appeal procedures, if applicable, are described in <a href="#Appeals">Section J, Appeals</a> below.</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong><a name="Time" id="Time"></a>(I) Time Frames for the Investigation, Adjudication, and Determination of Sanctions<br /></strong></span></p><p>Middlebury endeavors to limit the period from the commencement of an investigation through its adjudication (determination issued by the HRO), exclusive of any appeal(s), to ninety (90) calendar days. This time frame may be extended for good cause, which may exist if additional time is necessary to ensure the integrity and completeness of the investigation, to comply with a request by external law enforcement for temporary delay to gather evidence for a criminal investigation, to accommodate the availability of witnesses, to account for Middlebury breaks or vacations, to account for complexities of a case, including the number of witnesses and volume of information provided by the parties, or for other legitimate reasons. Once the investigation and adjudication process is initiated under Section 10 of this policy, the parties will be given notice of the date and time of any related meetings, interviews or proceedings that they may attend.  While each party may have an advisor of choice, Middlebury will not permit advisor scheduling to unreasonably delay or extend the investigation and/or adjudication process. The JAO will notify the parties in writing of any extension of this time frame and the reason for such extension. The JAO will also consider extension requests from the parties.</p><p>The time frames applicable to appeals are stated in <a href="#Appeals">Section J, Appeals</a>, below.  </p><p>Absent extenuating circumstances, the appropriate supervisory authority or responsible official will issue a decision regarding discipline and/or other appropriate action (for example, in the case of a faculty respondent who is subject to the Middlebury College Faculty Handbook, initiation of a Misconduct Review), to the extent applicable, within 5 days after the deadline for submission of Sanction Statements by the parties, or within 5 days after completion of any appeals of the HRO’s original determination, as applicable (see “Appeals in Middlebury College Faculty-Respondent Cases”).  In faculty or staff matters, this time period may be shorter or longer depending on the circumstances, including any contractual rights of the parties.</p><p><strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="Appeals" id="Appeals"></a>(J)  Appeals</span> </strong></p><p>The complainant and respondent each has the right to appeal the outcome under the circumstances described below. Regardless of which party appeals, both parties may participate in the appeals process as provided below. The JAO will provide written notification to the complainant and the respondent of any applicable appeal procedures at the time the complainant and respondent receive notice of the result. The appeal procedures, if any, will vary depending on whether the respondent is a student, a staff member, or a member of the faculty. The purpose of an appeal is to review the adjudication process, the imposition of a sanction, or both, depending on which appeal procedure, if any, applies. </p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Appeals in Student-Respondent Cases</span></p><p>Appeals are accepted on the basis of one or more of the following:</p><ul><li>discovery of significant new factual material not available to the HRO that could have affected the original result; however, prior omission of factual information that the appealing party knew or should reasonably have known about is not a ground for an appeal;</li><li>procedural error where the error prevented fundamental fairness;</li><li>abuse of discretion in the issuance of a sanction, meaning that the appropriate supervisory authority imposed a sanction significantly disproportionate to the offense.</li></ul><p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Procedures</span></p><p>An appeal must be made in writing to the appellate officer for the program in connection with which the HRO determination, and sanction as applicable, was made.

See <a href="#AppB">Appendix B</a> for contact information.</p><p>In cases where the HRO refers a student-respondent matter to multiple supervisory authorities for further disciplinary action in accordance with <a href="#Sanction">Section 10(H)3, Sanction</a>, above, an appeal of the sanction(s) issued in the other Middlebury program(s) can also be made to the appellate officer(s) for the other Middlebury program(s). In cases where appeals are submitted to multiple supervisory authorities, those authorities may collaborate with each other as appropriate.</p><p>Appeals must be made within five days of receipt of the HRO’s determination in cases where the respondent has not been found responsible for a policy violation, or within five days of receipt of the decision regarding sanctions and/or other actions, if applicable. The JAO/HRO and/or Middlebury official hearing the appeal may extend this deadline if warranted by the circumstances; please see <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/misc/October#Time">Section 10(I), Time Frames</a>, above, for more information. Appeals transmitted via e-mail will be considered to be “in writing” for the purposes of this section.</p><p>The appealing party ("the appellant") must submit evidence and/or arguments they believe support any of the three grounds for appeal listed above, and their explanation of the evidence or arguments.  The Middlebury official responsible for hearing the appeal (e.g., VPAA/Dean of the Faculty, Provost, VPAA/Dean of the Institute, or designee) will share these materials with and invite an informational response from the JAO, HRO and/or the appropriate disciplinary authority, if applicable, and the other party ("the appellee"), who may respond within five business days of the request. The appellee’s response will be shared with the appellant, who may submit a final response to only those matters raised by the appellee's response within five business days.

In all cases, the appropriate supervisory authority or authorities will issue a sanction and/or take other action that is reasonably calculated to address the prohibited conduct and prevent its recurrence.</p><h4><strong><a name="Scope" id="Scope"></a>11. Scope of Oversight (Students)</strong></h4><p>Students will be held accountable for policy violations that take place between the time they first arrive on campus to begin their Middlebury program and their graduation or completion of their program, or Middlebury’s confirmation of their resignation or expulsion. Conduct that takes place on or near Middlebury premises or property; occurs at or in connection with a Middlebury-related event; or occurs off-campus but may represent a threat to the safety of the Middlebury community or any of its members, the pursuit of its objectives, and/or the educational environment of others, may be subject to Middlebury’s disciplinary process. Middlebury retains sole discretion to determine whether to initiate an investigation and adjudication under this policy regardless of the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by a non-Middlebury institution or program and/or the outcome of any law enforcement investigation or court proceeding.</p><p>In cases where a student is found responsible for a policy violation while participating in any Middlebury program, the finding of responsibility may also be referred to the appropriate authority overseeing any additional Middlebury program in which the student is or will be enrolled for other action as deemed appropriate (see also <a href="#Sanction">Section 10(H)3, Sanction, </a>above). This may include but is not limited to further investigation; additional adjudication under existing policies (using only information gathered in the first disciplinary process, or using subsequently gathered information, or both, as deemed appropriate by the overseeing authority); disciplinary action; or other remedies or processes deemed appropriate by the authority overseeing the additional Middlebury program.</p><h4><strong><a name="Pending" id="Pending"></a>12. </strong><strong>Pending Discipline (Students)</strong></h4><p>A student respondent will not be permitted to graduate from or otherwise be deemed to have officially completed a program in which they are enrolled while a disciplinary matter is pending; the student’s graduation or certification will be held in abeyance until the matter is resolved. If a respondent withdraws with a disciplinary matter, sanction, or appeal pending, the withdrawal will be considered a resignation from Middlebury, and the student will have given up the opportunity to return to Middlebury. The student’s official status at Middlebury will reflect the point in the process at which they withdrew, and the nature of the finding and sanction, as appropriate. Examples include but are not limited to "Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Matter Pending," "Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Sanction Pending," and "Withdrawal with a Disciplinary Appeal Pending."</p><p>In extraordinary circumstances, the appropriate supervisory authority may, after appropriate consultation, a review of the case, and consideration of Middlebury’s best interests, grant permission for a respondent to withdraw from Middlebury when a disciplinary matter is pending. If the student is readmitted to Middlebury, the disciplinary matter must be resolved either before the student's return, or immediately upon the student's return (as determined by Middlebury).</p><h4><strong><a name="Emergency" id="Emergency"></a>13. Emergency Withdrawal, Suspension, or Expulsion (Students)</strong></h4><p>Middlebury reserves the right, notwithstanding and apart from the procedures described above, on an emergency basis, to suspend, expel or require to withdraw any student whose presence at Middlebury is determined by Middlebury authorities (e.g., vice president for student affairs and dean of the College; dean of students; dean of the Language Schools; dean of international programs; dean of CACS and Student Services; or the appropriate supervisory authority for the program, as applicable) to pose a danger to the Middlebury community or its members or to be unduly disruptive of College life, or who appears to be unwilling or incapable of effectively and/or safely participating in Middlebury’s academic or other programs and/or residential life. In cases of emergency suspension or required withdrawal, the conditions and procedures for readmission will be determined and communicated in writing to the student once the circumstances surrounding the student’s departure have been clarified.</p><p>Nothing in this policy should be read to limit Middlebury’s rights to terminate or suspend the employment of any staff or faculty member under otherwise-applicable Middlebury policies, practices, contracts, or procedures.</p><h4><strong><a name="Training" id="Training"></a>14. Training of Individuals Conducting Investigations and Adjudications<br /></strong></h4><p>Individuals conducting investigations and adjudications under this policy will receive training annually on issues related to sexual misconduct, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and related retaliation and on how to conduct a prompt, fair, and impartial investigation and/or adjudication process that protects the safety of complainants and promotes accountability.</p><h4><strong><a name="Plans" id="Plans"></a>1</strong><strong>5. Plans or Directives Issued by Middlebury Officials</strong><strong>  </strong></h4><p>In any case in which a finding of sexual misconduct, domestic or dating violence or misconduct, stalking or related retaliation has been issued, violation of a plan or directive to address the prohibited conduct may be grounds for further discipline.</p><h4><strong><a name="Cooperation" id="Cooperation"></a>16. Cooperation of All Parties</strong></h4><p>All witnesses identified in connection with an investigation under this policy are expected to cooperate fully in the investigation by providing complete, accurate, and truthful information. This policy prohibits intentionally making a false report or providing false or misleading information in any investigation under this policy. Complainants will not be deemed to have provided false or misleading information under this policy if their factual allegations are intended to be truthful and are made in good faith, regardless of whether the conduct complained of is ultimately found to constitute a policy violation.</p><p>Witnesses may be expected to sign statements or other documents memorializing the information provided in the course of the investigation and may be asked to keep the substance of the investigation interview confidential. Failure to cooperate fully with the investigator or other Middlebury official (including but not limited to providing false information, as described above) may subject the employee or student to the full range of disciplinary actions available to the supervising authority or responsible official in accordance with the program’s existing policies and/or contracts, as applicable, up to and including termination of employment or suspension or expulsion from Middlebury.</p><h4><strong><a name="Access" id="Access"></a>17.

Employees with disabilities may contact Human Resources.</p><h4><strong><a name="Records" id="Records"></a>19. Record Keeping</strong></h4><p>The HROs and JAOs will keep confidential records and/or reports under this policy and the actions taken in response to those reports, and use them for purposes such as to identify individuals or departments likely to benefit from training. The HROs/JAOs will track reports under this policy for statistical purposes and report to the president concerning the number, nature and disposition of such reports.</p><p>Contact information for the HROs and JAOs is available at several college offices: <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc">vice president for student affairs and dean of the College</a>, <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro/node/285479">Title IX Coordinator</a>, <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/judicial">JAOs</a>, <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro">HROs</a>, <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/commons">Commons deans</a>, <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/administration/aa_staff/node/481277">vice president for academic affairs/dean of faculty</a>, <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/middlebury_google_custom_search/go/Public Safety">Public Safety</a>, <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/middlebury_google_custom_search/go/Human Resources">Human Resources</a>, <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/international/sa/contacts/node/425371">vice president for Academic Affairs/dean of the Schools</a>, and <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/studentlife/doc/hro">the Institute’s HROs</a>.</p><h4><strong><a name="FacAdvisors" id="FacAdvisors"></a>20. Middlebury Faculty and Staff as Advisors</strong></h4><p>A Middlebury faculty or staff member who agrees to serve as an advisor to a complainant or respondent is not an agent of Middlebury when acting in that capacity and does not speak or act on Middlebury’s behalf while serving as an advisor.  The relationship between a party and non-confidential advisor is not confidential (or privileged), and the faculty or staff member’s duties to Middlebury--including all reporting obligations—remain intact.  Before agreeing to serve as an advisor, faculty and staff members should evaluate whether any conflict or potential conflict of interest may warrant their declining the invitation to serve as an advisor. In addition, only licensed attorneys can provide legal advice. As such, parties seeking legal advice should consult their attorney.<br /><br /></p><hr /><h3><strong><a name="AppA" id="AppA"></a>Appendix A</strong><strong>: Applicable Definitions: U.S. State and Federal Law where Middlebury Operates Programs</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="#Vermont">Vermont</a><strong><br /></strong></li><li><a href="#California">California</a></li><li><a href="#DOColumbia">District of Columbia</a></li><li><a href="#Nevada">Nevada</a></li><li><a href="#NewMex">New Mexico</a></li><li><a href="#VAWAdefs">The Violence Against Women Act</a></li></ul><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="Vermont" id="Vermont"></a>VERMONT</span></strong></p><p><strong>Consent</strong> is defined to mean “words or actions by a person indicating a voluntary agreement to engage in a sexual act.”<a href="#FN3">[3]</a></p><p><strong>Sexual Assault:  </strong>Sexual assault is engaging in a sexual act with another person and compelling the other person to participate in a sexual act:</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(1)  without the consent of the other person; or</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(2) by threatening or coercing the other person; or</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(3) by placing the other person in fear of imminent bodily injury.</p><p>No person shall engage in a sexual act with another person and substantially impair the ability of the other person by administering or employing drugs or intoxicants without the knowledge of or against the will of the other person.<a href="#FN4">[4]</a></p><p>A “sexual act” means conduct between persons consisting of contact between the penis and the vulva, the penis and the anus, the mouth and the penis, the mouth and the vulva, or any intrusion, however slight, by any part of a person’s body or object into the genital or anal opening of another.<a href="#FN5">[5]</a></p><p><strong>Domestic Violence:  </strong>Domestic assault is attempting to cause or to willfully or recklessly cause bodily injury to a family or household member or to willfully cause a family or household member to fear imminent serious bodily injury.<a href="#FN6">[6]</a> “Household members” are those persons who, for any period of time, are living or have lived together, are sharing or have shared occupancy of a dwelling, are engaged in or have engaged in a sexual relationship, or minors or adults who are dating or have dated.<a href="#FN7">[7] </a></p><p><strong>Dating Violence:</strong>  Domestic assault includes attempting to cause or to willfully or recklessly cause bodily injury to a person one is dating or has dated or to willfully cause such person to fear imminent serious bodily injury.<a href="#FN8">[8]</a>  “Dating” is defined as a social relationship of a romantic nature.  Factors to consider in determining whether a dating relationship exists or existed, include:</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(a) the nature of the relationship;</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(b) the length of time the relationship has existed;</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(c) the frequency of the interaction between the parties; and</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(d) the length of time since the relationship ended, if applicable.<a href="#FN9">[9] </a></p><p><strong>Stalking:  </strong>“Stalking” is defined to mean engaging in a course of conduct which consists of following, lying in wait for, or harassing a person, when such conduct:</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(a)  serves no legitimate purpose; and</p><p style="padding-left:30px">(b)  would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her physical safety or health or would cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress. </p><p>“Following” means maintaining, over a period of time, a visual or physical proximity to another person in such a manner as would cause a reasonable person to have a fear of unlawful sexual conduct, unlawful restraint, bodily injury or death. </p><p>“Lying in wait” means hiding or being concealed for the purpose of attacking or harming another person. </p><p>“Harassing” means actions directed at a specific person, or a member of the person’s family, which would cause a reasonable person to fear unlawful sexual conduct, unlawful restraint, bodily injury, or death, including but not limited to verbal threats, written, telephonic, or other electronically communicated threats, vandalism, or physical contact without consent.<a href="#FN10">[10]</a></p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a name="California" id="California"></a>CALIFORNIA</span></strong></p><p><strong>Consent</strong> means positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will.

Because this is the criminal system, the police will have to decide whether what happened to you was a crime and when there is “probable cause.”… They will then decide whether or not to charge and arrest the perpetrator.  A person charged with a crime is called a defendant. The choice of reporting a sexual assault to the police can be difficult. Advocates from your local network program are available to provide you more information about reporting and can support you in whatever you decide is right for you.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><strong>What happens after the perpetrator is arrested?<br /></strong>An arrest is the beginning of the criminal process. Once someone is arrested they may be released immediately, released at any point in the criminal process or, in severe cases, remain in jail. This will depend on many complicated legal factors. Defendants released from jail before the end of the case will be given “conditions of release” by the court. This is an order that the defendant must follow while the criminal case is going forward. Often the conditions will tell the defendant not to have contact with you as the victim of the crime. As a victim of a crime you have the right to know if and when the defendant is getting released from jail and his/her conditions of release. Some victims may have increased safety concerns following an arrest. You may call your local Network program for more information and support.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><strong>Prosecution of crimes of sexual violence <br /> </strong>Following a charge/arrest, the police transfer the case to the prosecutor, also called the state’s attorney. A prosecutor is a lawyer who works for the state through the state’s attorney’s office. The state’s attorney’s job is to continue to gather evidence to prove that the defendant committed the crime and to prepare the case against the defendant. The state’s attorney decides how to proceed with the criminal case.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><strong>State’s Attorneys’ Victim Advocates<br /></strong>The state’s attorney’s office also has its own victim advocates. They provide information and updates on the case. They can also offer support and help with communicating your concerns and questions to the state’s attorney. Because these advocates work for the state’s attorney, they are not confidential. This means that the state’s attorney’s advocates may be required to share relevant information you share about the case with the state’s attorney.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"> <strong>Sentencing<br /></strong>If the defendant pleads guilty or is found guilty after a trial, the judge will impose a sentence. A sentence may include a probation term, time in jail or a combination of both. In many cases, sentencing will also require the defendant to participate in a sex offender treatment program. You may be present in the court room during the sentencing if you want. As a victim you have the right to make a “Victim Impact Statement” to the court. This is your time to describe the impact that the crime had upon you and your family.

Middlebury will support individuals if they wish to have Middlebury’s assistance in making contact with law enforcement authorities and other external resources to seek such orders. Individuals may request assistance by contacting a JAO, HRO, Title IX Coordinator, Public Safety or program director. Contact may be made via email, phone, teleconference or in person See contact information below. Middlebury will comply with and respect such orders to the extent applicable.</p><p><strong>Additional Summaries from the National Domestic Violence Hotline:</strong><strong></strong></p><p style="padding-left:30px">A protective order is an official legal order issued by a state court that requires the abusive person to stop the violence and abuse and maintain a certain distance from the victim. Depending on where you live, it can also be called a restraining order, protection order, an injunction, or an order of protection.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><em>How do I get a protective order?</em><br /> Different states have different processes, but as a general rule, appropriate forms have to be filled out and submitted to the county court house. A court date will be scheduled and both parties will be notified. If you are under 18, you will likely need parental consent.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><em>Why would I get a protective order?</em><br /> A protective order is legal protection against the abusive partner and can be enforced by police. Special provisions can be requested such as custody of children, continued financial support, getting the abuser to leave the residence, etc. Some states also require the abusive partner to surrender their firearms.</p><p style="padding-left:30px">It’s important to note that while a protective order may help keep an abusive partner away from you, it does not work in every case. Some abusive partners continue to contact and abuse their partners despite the presence of a protective order. Some may become even more dangerous after an order is filed because it threatens their power and control over the relationship. While you cannot predict someone’s behavior, you know your situation best, and it’s a good idea to consider how your partner might react based on what you know about them before obtaining a protection order.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><em>What happens when I get a protective order?</em><br /> When the abuser does something that the court has ordered them not to do, or doesn’t do something the court has ordered them to do, they may have violated the order. You can ask the police or the court (or both, depending on the violation) to enforce the order. If you are not able to contact the police when the violation occurs, they should take a report if you call them soon afterwards. In some cases, violating a protective order might result in a misdemeanor or felony criminal conviction and punishment. These types of violations can also later be addressed by a civil court, and it is often a good idea to bring them to the court’s attention.</p><p style="padding-left:30px">Things to consider before obtaining a protective order:</p><ul><li>PROS: You will have legal documentation of protection; the abuse may stop; provisions can be made for children, finances, etc.; <a href="http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=780&amp;state_code=GA" target="_blank">can still be enforced if you move or leave your home state</a></li><li>CONS: You will have to see the abusive partner in court; abuse may not decrease/abusive partner may not obey the order; some orders are not always enforced</li></ul><p style="padding-left:30px">Please note that police reports and protective orders are just parts of an overall <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/help/path-to-safety/" target="_blank">safety plan</a> and do not guarantee your safety from an abusive partner. <em>Remember, you are the most knowledgeable person about your own situation, and you must use your own judgment about what is best for you</em>. If you are considering taking legal steps against an abusive partner, we strongly recommend that you get in touch with a legal advocate, and we can help you find one in your area. Please call us at 1-800-799-7233 or chat online from 7am-2am CST.</p><p style="padding-left:30px"><strong>Resources and additional information:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.vinelink.com/vinelink/initMap.do" target="_blank">VINE (Victim Information &amp; Notification Everyday)</a>: This service provides information about criminal cases and the custody status of offenders 24 hours a day</li><li>Full Faith and Credit: Refers to Section 2265 of VAWA and requires that a valid protection order issued in one state be treated another state as if it were one of its own.

This report will be forwarded to the Middlebury College Department of Public Safety. The CSA report form is located on the College’s webpage: <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/csa">http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/health/publicsafety/csa</a>.<br /><br />If a Middlebury student, staff or faculty person becomes aware of a crime or emergency or needs to make a request for related assistance connected with a noncampus location in the United States or abroad (that is, any building or property owned or controlled by Middlebury that is used in direct support of Middlebury’s educational purposes and which is frequently used by students, but which is not within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area as one of Middlebury’s campuses), they are encouraged to immediately contact the on-site director or designee.</p><hr /><h3><a name="AppF" id="AppF"></a>Appendix F: Sanctions</h3><p><strong>Appendix F. Sanctions</strong></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sanctions for Students</span></p><p>Sanctions for students found responsible for committing policy violations are listed below. Sanctions are designed to accomplish several goals: to deter harmful conduct; to cultivate responsibility and accountability to self and others; to address the underlying harm including the wellbeing or safety of any individual and/or the community; to eliminate any hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, and correct its discriminatory effects on the complainant and others, if applicable; and to provide other appropriate forms of redress and/or rehabilitation.  Sanctions are recorded in the student's file, and are not reflected on the academic transcript, except that Middlebury enrollment dates are part of the transcript record. Sanctions that constitute a form of official discipline, as noted below, are included in a student’s permanent record and may/must be disclosed by the respondent and/or by Middlebury under certain circumstances.</p><p>The<em> </em>sanctions below are listed in order of increasing severity.<em>  </em></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Unofficial Forms of Discipline</span><br /> <em>Warnings:</em> A verbal or written warning may be issued when a student has violated Middlebury policy. A warning is intended to educate the student about community standards, Middlebury policies and/or state laws, and the need to adhere to them. A warning is informal,unofficial discipline and is not part of the student's official record. Students who receive a warning can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Middlebury school or program. Warnings are taken into account in determining future disciplinary outcomes and may serve to make further violations of Middlebury regulations more serious.<br /> <br /> <em>Reprimands:</em> A letter of reprimand may be issued when a student demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to abide by community standards by repeatedly violating Middlebury policy. A letter of reprimand may also be issued when a student has committed a violation of Middlebury policy that has had or may have had a negative impact on an individual or on the community, or has undermined Middlebury’s community standards. A reprimand registers strongly Middlebury’s concern regarding the student’s actions and its firm expectations for immediate improved behavior.  <br /><br /> Parents or guardians are informed when undergraduate students are reprimanded.  A letter of reprimand is informal, unofficial discipline and is not part of the student’s official record. Students who receive reprimands can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Middlebury school or program. Reprimands are taken into account in determining future disciplinary outcomes and may serve to make further violations of Middlebury regulations more serious.<br /> <br /> <em>Probationary Status:</em> Students may be placed on probationary status when the number or nature of their Middlebury policy violation(s) is sufficiently concerning that an additional policy violation will most likely result in an <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/student_policies/general_disciplinary_processes#ocd">official form of discipline</a> (please see below).  Probationary status provides students with an opportunity to avoid this outcome. They may do so by demonstrating improved conduct, generally reflected in their sustained ability to respect community standards and adhere to Middlebury policies. <br /> <br /> If students commit new policy violations while on probationary status, an appropriate course of action will be determined. Considerations may include the gravity and impact of the new infraction; the student’s response during and following the new infraction; and the student’s progress during the probationary period. <br /> <br /> Parents or guardians are informed when undergraduate students are placed on probationary status. Probationary status is informal, unofficial discipline and is not part of the student’s official record. Students who are placed on probationary status can answer negatively if they are asked if they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Middlebury school or program. It is important to note that discipline is cumulative at Middlebury, and further infractions following the successful conclusion of the probationary period may still result in more severe outcomes. <br /> <br /> <span style="text-decoration:underline">Official Forms of Discipline<br /> </span><em>Letter of</em> <em>Official Discipline:</em> Students may receive a letter of official discipline when their actions have demonstrated disregard for Middlebury’s community standards and policies such that an additional infraction of Middlebury policy will most likely result in suspension from Middlebury. A letter of official discipline is intended to encourage immediate improved behavior and acceptance of responsibility and growth by establishing this incident on the student's permanent record. <br /> <br /> Letters of official discipline are a permanent part of the student's official record.  Students who receive a letter of official discipline must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Middlebury school or program. Parents or guardians of undergraduate students are informed when students receive a letter of official discipline.<br /> <br /> <em>Suspension:</em> Suspension is issued when a student commits a serious policy violation, or repeatedly violates Middlebury policy, thereby demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to behave in a manner consistent with Middlebury’s community standards.  The behavior is sufficiently egregious that the student is required to leave the Middlebury community for a period of time. It is intended to encourage acceptance of responsibility and growth by establishing this incident on the student's permanent record; to provide the student with an opportunity to consider and address the problematic behavior; and to develop strategies to ensure that the student’s eventual return to Middlebury will be successful for the student, for the individuals affected by the student's actions, and for the community. <br /> <br /> Suspension may be imposed for any length of time, but is normally imposed for a period no longer than one and one half academic years.  In determining the length of suspension, the sanctioning authority will consider the student’s prior conduct history; the gravity of the violation and its impact on the community; the needs of the complainant/affected party; and the need for sufficient time for the student to demonstrate that the concerning behavior has been satisfactorily addressed. When the sanctioning authority feels that suspension for one and one half academic years is insufficient to allow for a student’s successful return to the community, expulsion will be the normal outcome, barring exceptional circumstances.  <br /> <br /> Students who are suspended for four weeks or longer who wish to return to or be reinstated at Middlebury must apply for readmission or reinstatement. Undergraduate students seeking readmission to or reinstatement in the undergraduate college must apply through the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/student_policies/student_fines">Administration Committee</a>; all other students must apply though the appropriate supervisory authority of their school or program. All applicants for readmission or reinstatement after suspension must demonstrate readiness to return to Middlebury. Readiness to return is determined by a student’s adherence to the terms of the sanction and the deadlines of the readmission process; by the completion of any additional conditions that may have been established at the time of the student’s departure; and by the provision of satisfactory evidence that the problematic behavior will not recur. If a student is unable to demonstrate readiness to return at the stated conclusion of the period of suspension, the Administration Committee or the appropriate supervisory authority may deny readmission or reinstatement until it is satisfied that the conditions that led to the student’s departure have been appropriately addressed. <br /> <br /> Suspension is a form of official discipline and is a permanent part of the student's record. Students who are suspended must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Middlebury school or program. Students who are suspended must leave campus; are restricted from all Middlebury-owned or rented properties; and are prohibited from participating in all Middlebury activities or programs, from employment by Middlebury, and from using Middlebury facilities during the stated period of the suspension. When suspension prohibits students from completing a semester or program they have already begun, the comprehensive fee for that semester or program is not refunded. Parents or guardians are informed when undergraduate students are suspended. For international students, suspension may affect immigration status; related questions may be directed to the Office of International Student and Scholar Services. <br /> <br /> <em>g. Expulsion:</em> For particularly serious offenses, students may be permanently expelled from Middlebury. In cases of expulsion from Middlebury, no refund of the comprehensive fee or other program fee, as applicable, is made. Parents or guardians are informed when undergraduate students are expelled. Expulsion is a form of official discipline and is a permanent part of the student's record. Students who are expelled must answer affirmatively if they are asked whether they have been subject to official discipline while enrolled in any Middlebury school or program.<span style="text-decoration:underline"></span></p><p>Fines or restitution commensurate with the nature of the offense may also be assigned. The monetary cost of the harm done may be taken into account in assessment of a fine or an order of restitution. See the Handbook, <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/student_policies/student_fines">Student Life Policies, Fines and Fees</a>.</p><p>Middlebury may also take other non-disciplinary action as deemed appropriate under the circumstances (e.g., remedies applied to the respondent to address the needs of the complainant and/or the community, including but not limited to room changes, class changes, building restrictions, extracurricular activity restrictions, modification of No Contact Orders to favor the complainant, No Trespass Orders, and other actions to preserve the rights of the complainant and the community to a safe environment). These may also include case-specific requirements for reinstatement or readmission after suspension, including but not limited to evidence from appropriately certified professionals who are aware of the respondent’s circumstances and can document satisfactory progress by the respondent on the issues at hand.  </p><p>As noted in section <a href="#Investigation">10. Investigation (H),</a> if the conduct occurred during the course and scope of the student’s employment at Middlebury, the matter will be referred jointly to the Human Resources Department and the appropriate supervisory authority for the program at issue, as applicable, for disciplinary sanctions that may include written reprimands, or termination of employment in addition to the disciplinary sanctions and non-disciplinary actions noted above, as deemed appropriate.  </p><p>Regardless of the finding, non-disciplinary outcomes, such as training, or extending and/or modifying mutual No Contact Orders and/or No Trespass Notices, may be imposed.</p><p>Middlebury may provide notice of the matter to the appropriate supervisory authority of any Middlebury program in which the respondent intends to participate, who may consider this information in determining the respondent's admission to the program and/or other program participation parameters, as appropriate. Receipt of sanctions may impact future Middlebury opportunities, including but not limited to employment, leadership position selection, or approval for participation in Study Abroad, Language Schools, MiddCORE, the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, or any other Middlebury program. Notification of a finding of responsibility, sanction, or other action under this policy may also be provided to the home institution of non-Middlebury undergraduate and graduate students or any other program in which the student is enrolled or to which the student is pursuing enrollment.</p><p>Prior conduct and judicial history in all Middlebury programs may be taken into account in determining sanctions. Although discipline is cumulative at Middlebury--meaning greater sanctions may be imposed for repeated or accumulated violations--it is not progressive. That is, depending on the severity of the violation or violations, a student may receive any of the sanctions noted above, even for a first offense.</p><p>Based on the considerations noted above, Middlebury does not utilize a formula when determining an appropriate sanction for a policy violation or violations. As a result, sanctions will be tailored to the circumstances of a particular case, considering factors such as, but not limited to, the needs of any complainant or affected party, the nature of the misconduct, and the disciplinary history of the respondent</p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Sexual Assault </span>(includes rape, fondling, incest and statutory rape) <br /> Possible Sanctions: reprimand, probationary status, letter of official discipline, suspension or expulsion.
