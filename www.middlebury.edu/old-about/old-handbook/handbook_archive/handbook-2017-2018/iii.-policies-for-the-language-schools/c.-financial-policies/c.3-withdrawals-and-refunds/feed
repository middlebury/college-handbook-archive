This withdrawal fee is assessed because a place has been reserved for the student and cannot, therefore, be filled by another student. The Language Schools will not provide a refund if a student withdraws after the end of the fifth day of classes (see chart for deadlines by session). &lt;span&gt;Students who cancel before the start date of any program forfeit the non-refundable deposit only.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students who have utilized Federal Student Aid eligibility (loans and/or grants) will be subject to the Return of Title IV regulations set forth by the US Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;2018 Withdrawal Deadlines&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Program, Session, Refund Deadline*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese 8-week program – June 29&lt;br /&gt;Chinese 6-week program – July 11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;French 6-week program in Paris – June 22&lt;br /&gt;French 7-week program – July 6&lt;br /&gt;French 6-week program in Vermont – July 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German 7-week program – July 6&lt;br /&gt;German 6-week program – July 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hebrew 7-week program – July 6&lt;br /&gt;Hebrew 3-week, 1st session – July 6&lt;br /&gt;Hebrew 6-week program – July 6&lt;br /&gt;Hebrew 3-week, 2nd session – August 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese 8-week program – June 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portuguese 7-week program – June 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian 8-week program – June 29&lt;br /&gt;Russian 6-week program – July 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanish 6-week program in Buenos Aires – July 4&lt;br /&gt;Spanish 7-week program – July 6&lt;br /&gt;Spanish 6-week program in Vermont – July 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Refund deadlines expire at 5:00 pm on date noted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REAPPLICATION AFTER WITHDRAWAL:&lt;/strong&gt; An undergraduate or graduate student who wishes to reapply after having withdrawn or been asked to withdraw for medical or psychological reasons will be required to submit a medical readmission form. The form must be completed and signed by the treating physician or psychotherapist indicating that the student is prepared to undertake an intensive program of study and noting what specific accommodations, if any, the student will request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
