 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We strive to engage students&#039; capacity for rigorous analysis and independent thought within a wide range of disciplines and endeavors, and to cultivate the intellectual, creative, physical, ethical, and social qualities essential for leadership in a rapidly changing global community. Through the pursuit of knowledge unconstrained by national or disciplinary boundaries, students who come to Middlebury learn to engage the world. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;                                                                        --from the Middlebury Mission Statement (2006)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This 2017-2018 Middlebury Handbook supersedes previous editions of the College Handbook and Directory as of its online publication date of September 11, 2017.  Section I applies to all students, faculty and staff of Middlebury programs, while other sections may apply only to specific populations, such as students of the undergraduate College.  The primary purposes of policies and discipline in an institution of higher education are to advance Middlebury’s educational mission by defining and establishing certain norms of behavior and to protect the well-being of the people who make up the Middlebury academic community. The goal of this Handbook is to express those common standards in a place that is available to every member of the community, and to those outside of our community who are interested in learning more about Middlebury. Included here are key Middlebury policies most likely to be applicable to and of interest to all Middlebury constituencies, with specific sub-sections devoted to specific constituencies.  Middlebury ensures compliance with local laws throughout its programs, in the United States and abroad, while setting common expectations for the behavior of all members of Middlebury programs.  However, practical considerations of style and a desire to present information to the Middlebury community in a useful, efficient manner dictate that this Handbook focus on the more general principles that govern our relationships to each other, rather than articulating multiple procedures and variances in implementation that ensure compliance with local laws.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
