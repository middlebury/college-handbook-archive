 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.1.a. Purpose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The purpose of the Faculty Handbook is to define relationships within the academic community of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. In particular, it sets forth the responsibilities, duties, and roles of the faculty, and the means by which the faculty as a body, through its committees, through its program chairs, and individually, participate in the governance process, the formulation and administration of academic policies, and personnel actions involving the employment of faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portions of the “Employee Handbook” also provide information that applies to faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms of employment of faculty members are determined by reference to the written letter of faculty appointment to the faculty member (which normally states a specific period of appointment); the Faculty Handbook; and those sections of Employee Handbook that apply to faculty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Faculty Handbook is the result of consultation among the Faculty Senate; the Faculty Assembly; administrative leadership, including deans and associate deans of the graduate schools, the vice president for academic affairs and dean of the Institute (VPAA), the Middlebury provost and president, the Institute Board of Overseers, and the Middlebury Board of Trustees. It supersedes the contents of Faculty Handbooks and their revisions that were issued prior to November 14, 2015. This version of the handbook is considered interim in nature -- reflecting a set of administrative, governance, and institutional name changes that have been implemented in the past year. A faculty working group, appointed by the Faculty Senate and charged by the provost with a broader examination of faculty governance issues, has reviewed the changes contained herein and will bring these and other changes to the Faculty Senate, Faculty Assembly, and relevant administrative and governing bodies at the appropriate point in its work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.1.b. Academic Policy-making and Administration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Academic policies are those relating to the education of students at the Institute. This includes instruction, curriculum development, and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic policy-making is a shared responsibility, with the various members of the Institute and broader Middlebury communities contributing according to their respective areas of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Academic policies are subject to ongoing review and updating. They are officially maintained in the Policies and Standards Manual, access to which is provided to all faculty and students through the Institute’s Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.1.c. Graduate Schools&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;To accomplish its mission, the Institute is organized into two schools, each headed by a dean, research centers headed by directors, and various staff to manage academic support functions. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The schools are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Graduate School of International Policy and Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Graduate School of Translation, Interpretation, and Language Education&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These schools are autonomous in curricular and academic matters, within the bounds of Institute-wide policies and standards described in this Handbook and in the Policies and Standards Manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C.1.d. Research Centers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Institute recognizes, encourages, and supports research for the purpose of accomplishing the educational mission of the Institute, enhancing its reputation, and facilitating the professional currency of the faculty. Any research center or project established at the Institute is bound by the laws, regulations, and policies applicable to all staff, faculty, and organizations at the Middlebury Institute. The directors of such centers report to the Executive Director of Research Centers and Initiatives. Certain research center directors and staff members may have faculty appointments, issued in accordance with the appointment procedures described in this Handbook. Current research centers and projects at the Institute are described on the Institute’s website.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
