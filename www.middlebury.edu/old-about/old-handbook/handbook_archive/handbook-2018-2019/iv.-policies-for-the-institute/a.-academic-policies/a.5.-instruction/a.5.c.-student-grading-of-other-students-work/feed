 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Graduate assistants or work-study students acting as teaching assistants shall not participate in the evaluation or grading of the work of other students. In exceptional cases, faculty such as those teaching a practicum or methods course in language teaching may have their students correct the written work of students taking a lower language course. Such faculty-supervised correction is appropriate so long as it does not entail a student giving another student an evaluation or grade. In such cases, the supervising faculty shall ensure the anonymity of the student whose work is being corrected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
