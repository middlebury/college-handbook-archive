 <title>A.5.e. Internships</title>
 <link>https://www.middlebury.edu/old-about/old-handbook/handbook_archive/handbook-2018-2019/iv.-policies-for-the-institute/a.-academic-policies/a.5.-instruction/a.5.e.-internships/node/632421</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Graduate Schools at the Middlebury Institute offer immersive learning experiences that are either credit or non-credit bearing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internships are a valuable and typical component of the MIIS educational experience. Internships generally do not carry academic credit, although academic credit can be arranged in exceptional cases by means of a Directed Study. In general, please consult with your academic and career advisor about internship opportunities.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In addition:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;language internships,&lt;/strong&gt; please consult with the language studies advisor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MIIS has&lt;strong&gt; translation and interpretation&lt;/strong&gt; internship programs with numerous companies, agencies, and institutions. Interested students should discuss internship possibilities with their career and academic advisor and their T&amp;amp;I language coordinator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In GSIPM&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as a rule, the School does not give academic credit for internships. However, students sometimes find it difficult to accept unpaid internships without financial aid, which is contingent upon being registered for academic credits. Thus they request directed studies that dovetail with their internships. The School allows this only if in addition to the expected internship work, the student expands upon the experience in the internship and conducts a research project that has sufficient academic rigor for consideration as graduate credit coursework. A clear work plan and timeline should be included in the substantive proposal. A research report is a typical outcome for a Directed Study project related to an internship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
