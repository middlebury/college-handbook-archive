 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Graduate students in the Arabic, French, Italian, Russian and Spanish Schools register for courses in BannerWeb and receive an email with instructions on registration procedures. All other Language Schools and programs hold course registration on site after arrival. Once students have selected courses with their advisors, registration information is sent directly to the Registrar’s Office. Students’ courses will be listed on BannerWeb on the first day of class. If an error in scheduling occurs, students need to check with the coordinator of their Language School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADD/DROP Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Add/Drop cards are available in each School office. Students must obtain the signatures of the instructors involved in the added and dropped courses, as well as signature of the director or associate director of the School. The following chart lists the deadlines.  A $10 late fee is assessed for course changes after the deadline. Students cannot add new courses after the Add/Drop deadline. Courses dropped before the Add/Drop deadline do not appear on transcripts. Courses dropped after the posted deadlines, but on or before July 10 for Arabic, Italian and Korean or July 17 for Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish will receive a grade of WD on the transcript. Courses dropped after July 10 for Arabic, Italian and Korean or July 17 for Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish receive a grade of WDF on the transcript. Notifying an instructor of non-attendance does not constitute official withdrawal from a course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add/Drop Deadlines:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Arabic and Korean 8-week sessions: &lt;strong&gt;June 25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Italian 7-week session: &lt;strong&gt;July 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Arabic and Italian 6-week sessions: &lt;strong&gt;July 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;All 3-week sessions at Mills: end of the third day of class&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;* Last date to drop without grade penalty &lt;span&gt;for Arabic, Italian and Korean programs on the Mills College (CA) campus&lt;/span&gt; is&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; July 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;Chinese, Japanese and Russian 8-week sessions and the Portuguese School: &lt;strong&gt;July 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;French, German, Hebrew and Spanish 7-week sessions: &lt;strong&gt;July 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Hebrew 6-week session: &lt;strong&gt;July 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Russian 6-week session: &lt;strong&gt;July 10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Chinese, French, German and Spanish 6-week sessions: &lt;strong&gt;July 11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;All 3-week sessions: end of the third day of class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;** Last date to drop without grade penalty for Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish programs on the Middlebury VT campus is &lt;strong&gt;July 17 **&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credits and Credit Load&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All credit awarded by the Language Schools is defined in terms of units. One unit equals three semester hours of credit. Students enrolled in the eight-week session of the Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian Schools normally earn four units of credit. Students enrolled in the seven-week session of the French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish Schools normally earn three units of credit. Students enrolled in the six-week graduate programs of the Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and Spanish Schools normally earn three units of credit. Graduate students are not permitted to repeat a course for which they have received a passing grade and earned credit. For all other students, repeating a course is allowed only with permission of the director of the school. This permission only will be granted in exceptional cases. To request permission to repeat a course, non-graduate students must submit a request in writing. The request must include justification as to why permission to repeat courses should be considered. If approval to repeat a course (or courses) is granted, only the first grade is calculated into the grade point average, and the course is only counted once for credit, although both grades appear on the transcript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For transfer purposes, the student’s home institution determines how many credits, graduate or undergraduate, are granted. Students should consult their home campus advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All students must pay the full tuition even if they carry less than the full load of courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A degree must be earned within a 10-year period. All units of credit expire after 10 years, whether earned at Middlebury College or transferred from another institution. Thus, credit earned at the 2019 session will expire after the end of the 2029 session. The validity of a degree, which certifies a level of achievement, does not expire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auditing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, students may not audit intensive language program courses. However, with the permission of the director of the School and the instructor, and if space permits, regularly enrolled full-time students may audit additional courses at the graduate level in the same School without charge. In rare cases, regularly enrolled students may change their status to that of auditor with the permission of the director of the School, but not after the third week of the session. Students granted special permission to change their registration status from full-time registered to auditor will no longer be eligible for any grants or Federal loans. Auditors may not change their status to that of regularly enrolled students without permission of the director of the School, and not after the first week of the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, auditing privileges are granted to individuals not enrolled in one of the Language Schools, with the permission of the director of the School. Final decisions on the acceptance of auditors are not made until after the completion of formal registration of full-time students. On-campus housing cannot be guaranteed to auditors. Auditors are subject to the Language Pledge and they may take advantage of the co-curricular cultural program of the School, but they may not take an active part in classroom activities or expect out-of-class attention from faculty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audited courses are not recorded on the Middlebury transcript of the summer Language Schools or the Middlebury C.V. Starr Schools Abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditors should check with Language Schools offices about the availability of on-campus housing. After receiving permission from the director of the School to audit, auditors should see the Language Schools budget coordinator, in Sunderland 206, for payment of fees and MiddCard authorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditing costs per week: tuition=$1,350; room and board=$910.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
