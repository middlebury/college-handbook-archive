To minimize any potential issues with regard to relatives working  together, it is strongly recommended that an immediate family member does not  have supervisory responsibilities for another family member.Â Immediate family for the purpose of this policy is  defined as spouse, domestic partner, civil union partner, parent, grandparent, sibling,  or child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
