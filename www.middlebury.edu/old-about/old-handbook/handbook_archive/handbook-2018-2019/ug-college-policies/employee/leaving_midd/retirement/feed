 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The College has no standard retirement age. However employees who have met certain age and service requirements when they leave the College will be classified as &quot;Middlebury Retirees&quot; and may be eligible for certain retiree benefits. In order to be eligible for retiree benefits an employee must:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a) have been employed by the College in a benefits-eligible position for ten consecutive years following the attainment of age 45; or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b) be a faculty member who has resigned from a tenured position to take a part-time position, regardless of age or years of service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retiree benefits may include certain post-retirement benefit programs, a retirement gift from the College, retiree lunch benefits, retiree I.D. card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A retiree who has met the eligibility requirements for the dependent education programs will remain eligible for these programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact Human Resources for benefit eligibility details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last day prior to retirement must be a worked day or a Middlebury Holiday (it cannot be a CTO day or unpaid day), except that special rules apply to employees retiring as a result of disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middlebury College appreciates the advantages that phased or transitional retirement arrangements offer to both the employee and the College. Middlebury College is willing to work with employees on a case-by-case basis to assist them in a successful and fulfilling transition into retirement. Due to operational needs, not all options are open to all employees. Contact Human Resources at ext. 5465 for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
