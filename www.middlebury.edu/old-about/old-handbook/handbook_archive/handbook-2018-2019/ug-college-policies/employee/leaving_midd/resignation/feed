&lt;p&gt;Resignation is defined as employment termination initiated by an employee who  chooses to leave the College voluntarily. Employees who are considering leaving  Middlebury College for any reason are encouraged to discuss their situation with  their immediate supervisors before making a final decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the employee voluntarily leaves the College, it is expected that as much  notice as possible will be given. At least two working weeks&#039; notice is  customary for non-exempt (hourly paid) employees, while administrative and  professional staff (salaried) are expected to give at least one month&#039;s notice.  A letter of resignation addressed to the department head, stating the final  date(s) of employment will be forwarded to Human Resources. Before leaving, the  employee should contact the Human Resources office to confirm benefit transition  arrangements and to turn in ID cards, keys, and any other College  property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
