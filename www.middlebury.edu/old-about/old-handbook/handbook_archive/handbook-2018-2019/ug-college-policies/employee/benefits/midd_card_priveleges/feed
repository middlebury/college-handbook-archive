 <title>3.10 Midd Card Privileges</title>
 <link>https://www.middlebury.edu/old-about/old-handbook/handbook_archive/handbook-2018-2019/ug-college-policies/employee/benefits/midd_card_priveleges/node/632193</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;All employees of Middlebury College are eligible for an identification card, called a MiddCard, which entitles the employee to certain privileges including: access to athletic facilities, discounts at the College store, library privileges, and discounts at cultural and sporting events. In addition, the card allows door access to certain campus buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spouses or domestic partners of &lt;em&gt;benefits-eligible employees&lt;/em&gt; are eligible to receive a Spouse/Partner card with the same privileges as the employee card (except door access).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both employee and spouse/partner cards are valid only during the employee’s period of active employment. Employees who retire from the College may be eligible for a Retiree/Emeriti card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Questions regarding card eligibility can be directed to Human Resources; questions regarding new or replacement cards or door access should be directed to Public Safety; and questions regarding discounts, events, or athletic facilities access or policies should be directed to the responsible department (i.e. Book Store, Athletics, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
