 <title>4.10 Personal Leave of Absence</title>
 <link>https://www.middlebury.edu/old-about/old-handbook/handbook_archive/handbook-2018-2019/ug-college-policies/employee/time_away/personal_leave/node/632232</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally staff employees may wish to take time off for personal reasons*, that is in excess of normal vacation time and/or available CTO.  In such instances, employees may apply for a Personal Leave of Absence (LOA). Personal LOAs are discretionary and require approval from both the employee’s manager and from Human Resources. The minimum duration is one full pay period, and a Personal LOA may not exceed one year in duration. (Managers may, at their discretion, approve shorter absences without the formal Personal LOA process).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an approved Personal LOA an employee will receive no regular pay. Certain employee benefits may be negotiated with Human Resources during the approval process. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether or not the employee will continue to be eligible for employee benefits during the LOA;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if benefits continue, whether the employee will pay the employee-only portion of the cost or the full cost of the benefit;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if applicable, how the employee will pay for the benefits during the LOA (i.e. pre-pay, pay-as-you-go, etc.); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether or not the employee will be required to use accrued CTO time during the LOA (this is typical).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to request a Personal LOA, employees should contact the Human Resources office to initiate the application process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-exempt and exempt employees on approved Personal LOAs &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; accrue CTO time on the unpaid portion of the leave. CTO will accrue only on CTO hours used during the leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an approved Personal Leave of Absence, employees have the same job protection afforded active employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Employees needing time off for medical reasons or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition should refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/employee/time_away/family_medical_leave&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Family and Medical Leave Act &lt;/em&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
