All such committees will report to the faculty through the parent group. Any positions on such committees are filled through appointment by the Committee on Committees. The president is a member, ex officio, of all councils and committees.</p><p>No member of the faculty may serve simultaneously on more than one of the following committees: the Council on Reviews, the Faculty Council, the Educational Affairs Committee, the Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Strategy Committee, the Resources Committee, and the Appeals Council. Faculty members who will be on leave during the year in which a term is scheduled to begin are ineligible for election. A faculty member elected or appointed to a two- or three-year term on any of these committees who is on leave before the expiration of the term will serve the remaining year(s) of the term after returning from leave. A faculty member serving on any of these committees will normally not be eligible for election or appointment to any other committees. </p><p>Faculty members serving on the Council on Reviews, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Strategy Committee, or Resources Committee will earn one year of exemption, immediately following, from elected or appointed service on these committees for each year served. Time spent on leave does not count towards this exemption period. The exemption period will be automatically applied unless the faculty member requests to remain eligible for such service in the year(s) following their committee service. Members of the faculty will not be obligated to serve for more than a total of twelve (12) years on any combination of these committees or former versions of them, including the Committee on Reappointment, Teaching Resources Committee, and the Educational Council.</p><p>Any faculty member may request to be exempted from the ballots for elected committees and from selection for standing appointed committees, on an annual basis, for a period of time not to exceed four years in a career. Normally no more than two of these four years may be consecutive.</p><p>To be exempt from committee service during the following year, faculty members must normally notify the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty by November 1.</p><p>If more than 12 percent of the full-time faculty request exemptions for a given year, then the requests will be honored on the basis of seniority, as determined by date of first appointment to the faculty.</p><p>Elections for all elected faculty councils and committees will take place online. B<span>alloting for all committees will be conducted online and coordinated by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Faculty. </span>The vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DOF) will determine those members of the faculty, including faculty on leave, who are eligible to vote in the elections.</p><p>The online polls for each election will remain open for a minimum of two working days, defined as days on which classes are scheduled, weekdays during the period between Winter Term and the spring semester, or weekdays during the examination period.</p><p>The order of committee elections is as follows: Promotions Committee, Reappointments Committee, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, Committee on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Strategy Committee, Resources Committee, and Appeals Council. The schedule for elections in each academic year shall be determined by the VPAA/DOF in consultation with the Faculty Council. When there are open seats in need of appointment on a committee, the Faculty Council, in its role as Committee on Committees, will appoint new members immediately after the conclusion of balloting for that committee.</p><p></p><p><a name="PromoCom" id="PromoCom"></a><strong>1.A. The Promotions Committee of the Council on Reviews</strong></p><p> <strong>a.<em> Function</em></strong></p><p>The Promotions Committee advises the president on each case in which a faculty member is under review for promotion to tenure or to full professor, or is facing dismissal.</p><p>The vice president for Academic Affairs and dean of the faculty (VPAA/DOF) sits with the Promotions Committee. It is expected that during the course of a review for tenure, the president and provost will become familiar with the scholarship and teaching record of the candidate. All decisions and recommendations by both the committee, the president and the provost will be made and justified in accordance with the provisions and procedures specified in the Rules of Appointment and Tenure in the Faculty Handbook section of this handbook.</p><p>The committee as part of the Council on Reviews will hold an annual open meeting to explain its procedures and to respond to questions and concerns from the faculty.</p><p><strong>b. <em>Election</em></strong></p><p>i. The committee will consist of three tenured full professors from the full-time teaching faculty elected by the faculty.

Standing Committees</strong></p><p>The various standing committees will keep the Educational Affairs Committee informed of their activities through minutes of all their meetings. In a given year the EAC may also decide to concentrate its attention on the issues arising before a particular standing committee: at the EAC's request, one of its members may be named to sit on such a committee and to serve as a liaison between the two groups. The standing committees include:</p><p><em>i.

Only the members of the faculty and dean serve as voting members.</p><p>Middlebury’s academic policies embody the expectations that students are enrolled at Middlebury to pursue their academic degree; that they must adhere responsibly to the policies that support this goal; and that if factors arise that interfere with this goal, they will address them responsibly and/or seek help from Middlebury or external resources in a timely fashion. When evaluating petitions requesting exceptions to these policies, the Committee generally considers the following:</p><ul><li>the goals of the relevant policies;</li><li>the responsibilities of students and of the institution;</li><li>the principles of fairness to the petitioner and of fairness to all other affected parties;</li><li>the individual circumstances of the petitioner.</li></ul><p>Petitions may be approved, tabled, or denied. Petitions are tabled when the Committee identifies additional information needed for the evaluation; upon its receipt, the Committee resumes consideration. In cases of denial, petitioners who wish to provide relevant new or clarifying information may resubmit their petition to the Administration Committee for reconsideration.</p><p>Procedures for submitting a petition may be found on the <a href="http://www.middlebury.edu/student-life/academic-life/Administration-Committee">Administration Committee website</a>.</p><p><a name="athletic" id="athletic"></a>iii.<em> Athletic Policy Committee</em></p><p>The committee has the responsibility to formulate and recommend to the faculty policy concerning intercollegiate athletics for Middlebury College undergraduates, in accordance with the rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), and the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), in which Middlebury maintains membership.

Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (CDEI)</strong></p><p><em><strong>a. Function</strong></em></p><p>The Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is the primary faculty governance body addressing institutional and social diversity in the broadest sense, serving as an independent advocacy group, advisory body, and faculty network for exchange and support of ideas and policies. The committee consults and meets, at least once per academic year, with different entities such as the Senior Leadership Group, the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Strategy and Resources Committees, the Alliance for an Inclusive Middlebury, the Admissions Office, the Educational Affairs Committee and its subcommittees (in particular, the Curriculum Committee and Administration Committee). Its activities take two forms: reaching out to the relevant parts of the College to address issues raised among the faculty, and being a resource for various parts of the College to consult for a faculty perspective on diversity. It works to strengthen Middlebury’s commitment to the ideals, practices, and policies with which we collectively seek equity and inclusion across the institution by working with and through other institutional governance structures to provide recommendations that support students, staff and faculty work toward these goals. The committee's areas of attention may include but are not limited to the following:</p><p><span>1)  Faculty Leadership</span></p><p>The CDEI represents faculty perspectives on diversity policies and practices, and serves as the institutional connection between the administration and the faculty on issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity. It advocates for opportunities for all faculty members to learn more strategies to address these issues in their teaching, promote a culture of inclusivity, and enhance our potential for institutional transformation. The CDEI meets with the Provost at least once each semester, and with other members of the Senior Leadership Group as necessary. The CDEI also works with the Student Government Association and other relevant student groups (such as the Black Student Union, Women of Color, and Distinguished Men of Color) to ensure open and productive communication between students and faculty around issues pertaining to diversity at Middlebury.</p><p>2)  Policy Brokerage</p><p>The CDEI compiles and expresses faculty concerns and suggestions for transforming Middlebury’s status quo. It serves both as a sounding board for the administration to workshop its ideas for policy changes, and as a loudspeaker for faculty ideas. This brokerage function is particularly important for junior faculty with concerns and good ideas, who may be cautious about asserting themselves while working their way toward tenure.</p><p>3)  Communication and Reporting</p><p>The CDEI occasionally reports on its activities at faculty meetings, in addition to setting an agenda of targets and goals at the beginning of each academic year. It also responds to faculty questions and initiatives relating to issues of racism, diversity, and inclusion as these emerge from these meetings and the other mechanisms of faculty governance. At the end of each academic year, the CDEI will submit a brief report to the faculty on its deliberations and actions, and identify issues for consideration the following year. This report will be included in the minutes of the last plenary session of the faculty.</p><p>4)  Outreach</p><p>The CDEI annually engages the College faculty in a discussion of issues of race, diversity, and inclusion, especially as they relate to the College, and solicit faculty input regarding them. Pragmatically, this may take the form of an annual Summit on Diversity and Inclusion. The committee may also sponsor reading groups or lectures on topics related to issues in higher education that warrant consideration by the faculty. It can also keep records, numbers, and data about diversity issues in a centralized and public space, open to all faculty. This resource will solidify our institutional memory and support curricular and institutional innovations.</p><p><em><strong><strong>b. Composition</strong></strong></em></p><p>The CDEI will consist of six faculty members, with the Chief Diversity Officer serving as an ex officio member and attending its meetings at the committee’s invitation. The committee should reflect the diversity that Middlebury seeks to achieve. No more than two CDEI members shall be junior faculty. Faculty Council will be responsible for inviting and appointing some members of this committee, with the expectation that the procedure would maintain the CDEI’s autonomy in relation to rest of the College’s administration and governance structure. It will meet at least once per month, and more often as necessary.</p><p>Membership on the CDEI is open to all tenured faculty members, all pre-tenure faculty members on regular appointment, and all faculty members on special appointment who have contracts extending for at least one year beyond the date of the start of the term to which they would be elected or appointed. A member of the CDEI must have completed two years of full-time faculty status at Middlebury before their term begins. A member of the CDEI may not simultaneously serve on the Council on Reviews, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, Strategy Committee, Resources Committee, or Appeals Council. No more than two members of the CDEI may be from one division and no more than one member may be from one department. The departmental affiliation of the Chief Diversity Officer will not figure into the distribution of members.</p><p>The term for members of the CDEI is three years. Two of the positions will be elected by the faculty. The remaining four positions will be appointed by the Faculty Council in its role as the Committee on Committees. Faculty Council should consider ways to ensure that the CDEI membership includes interest in, expertise about, and community support on diversity issues. It could, for example, require that one of the Faculty Council-appointed positions be from an academic department that directly addresses diversity issues. It could create a student nomination process for another of these positions.</p><p>Elections and appointments will normally be for three-year terms. Positions that become vacant due to leaves, retirements, or for other reasons will be filled in the same way that the departing member was first selected for the committee: vacancies in elected positions will be filled by election, and vacancies in appointed positions will be filled by appointment.</p><p>The CDEI will elect one of its own tenured members as chair. The chair will run meetings, set meeting agendas, write reports, report to the faculty at plenary meetings, and coordinate work with other committee chairs as needed.</p><p><strong>c. <em>Election</em></strong></p><p>For election for the CDEI, a preliminary ballot will include a list of all eligible tenured members, all eligible pre-tenured faculty members on regular appointment, and all eligible faculty members on special appointment who have contracts extending for at least one year beyond the date of start of the term to which they would be elected. A member of CDEI must have completed two years of full-time faculty status at Middlebury before their term begins. Faculty members already serving on Council on Reviews, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, Strategy Committee, Resources Committee, those who will be on leave during the following year, and those made ineligible or whose obligation is waived because of stipulations set forth above are ineligible for election.  On the preliminary ballot, faculty members may vote for up to five candidates. Following the preliminary ballot, a second ballot will be distributed, listing the names of the five candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the preliminary ballot. Faculty members may vote for up to two candidates on the second ballot. After the second round of voting, a final ballot will be distributed, listing the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the second ballot. Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the final ballot. The candidate with the greatest number of votes will be declared elected.</p><p>If there is a second vacancy on the CDEI to be filled by election in a given year, the election procedure as described above will be repeated. If the vacancies are of different lengths, the longest vacancy will be decided by the first round of election, and shorter vacancies by subsequent rounds of election.</p><p>In the event of a tie vote on the preliminary ballot of any election, the names of candidates who received the five highest vote totals will be included on the second ballot. On the second ballot of any election, in the event of a tie among three or more candidates for first place, a runoff ballot will be issued, listing the names of the tied candidates. Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the runoff ballot. The names of the two candidates who received the greatest number of votes on the runoff ballot will appear on the final ballot. On the second ballot of any election, in the event of a tie among two or more candidates for second place, a runoff ballot will be issued, listing the names of the tied candidates. Faculty members may vote for one candidate on the runoff ballot. The name of the candidate who received the greatest number of votes on the runoff ballot will appear on the final ballot, along with the name of the candidate who received the greatest number of votes on the second ballot.</p><p><em><strong><strong>d. Procedures</strong></strong></em></p><p>In carrying out its functions, the CDEI may create <em>ad hoc</em> committees comprised of other faculty (and, as necessary, staff members and students) as needed.  The procedures for seeking approval of CDEI initiatives will be dictated by the nature of the initiative, but will follow existing channels for review as appropriate, including but not limited to the SGA, Community Council, Faculty Council, Educational Affairs Committee, and full faculty vote.  </p><p></p><p><strong><a name="strategy" id="strategy"></a>5. The Strategy Committee</strong></p><p><strong>a. <em>Function</em></strong></p><p>The Strategy Committee represents the College faculty in long-range strategic planning with the administration and the Board of Trustees. Though the committee is concerned primarily with the College, it will also represent the faculty in shared-governance discussions on matters of common interest to the College, the Schools, and the Institute. The committee is also charged with engaging the faculty, administration, and trustees on developments in higher education (both nationally and globally), as they might affect Middlebury College. In fulfilling this charge, the Strategy Committee will:</p><p>1. Work closely with the provost to develop and monitor long-range strategic planning especially as it relates to the integrity of Middlebury College and possible collaborations among it, the Schools, and the Institute.</p><p>2. Meet each fall and spring term, and at other times as necessary, with the Resources Committee to review Middlebury’s finances as they relate to current and long-range priorities involving the College’s mission. The Strategy Committee will meet with the provost once each fall and spring term, and at other times as necessary.</p><p>3. Consult with other elected or appointed faculty committees regarding issues that may be of special significance for their work on long-term strategic planning.</p><p>4. Meet with Faculty Council, and any other committees the Council invites, to collaborate on issues requiring broad discussion among leaders of the faculty.</p><p>5. Annually engage the College faculty in a discussion of issues of long-term strategy, especially as they relate to the College, and solicit faculty input regarding them. The committee may also sponsor reading groups or lectures on topics related to issues in higher education that warrant consideration by the faculty.</p><p>6. Meet regularly, as representatives of the College’s faculty, with the Strategy Committee of the Board of Trustees to review Middlebury’s long-range planning, especially as it relates to the academic mission of Middlebury College and its collaborations with the Institute and the Schools. When appropriate and by agreement with the administration and members of the Board’s Strategy Committee, these discussions may be held in confidence, with the expectation that in due course they will receive full and open discussion as any resultant decision-making procedure unfolds.</p><p>7. Contribute to the development of strategic plans initiated by the administration or the Board of Trustees. The committee will work with any ad hoc planning committee appointed by the administration or the Board, either through the appointment of one or more members of the Strategy Committee to the ad hoc planning committee, or through active consultation with the ad hoc planning committee.</p><p>8. At the end of each academic year submit a brief report to the faculty on its deliberations and actions, and identify issues for consideration the following year. This report will be included in the minutes of the last plenary session of the faculty.</p><p><strong>b. <em>Composition</em></strong></p><p>i.
