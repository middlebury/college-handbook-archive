 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Program Goals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office of the Dean for Faculty Development and Research will reimburse faculty for up to $450 of documented dependent care expenses (including care of children, aging parents, or other dependents) that result directly from professional development activity such as participation in conferences, travel for research, or visits with collaborators at other institutions.  The program is not designed to cover on-going dependent care expenses, but rather to address the additional burdens that flow from professional development activity, particularly activity that takes place away from Middlebury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guidelines and restrictions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The program will cover any dependent care expenses incurred beginning July 1, 2016. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The total sum for which an individual faculty member can be reimbursed during any single fiscal year is $450. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Funds are limited, and will be available on a first-come, first-served basis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The program is intended to cover &lt;em&gt;dependent care expenses&lt;/em&gt;.   Examples of qualified expenses include:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost of enrolling dependents in ‘day camps’ or organized child care offered by professional conferences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost of babysitters or nannies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cost of extended/additional hours in a child’s regular day care center (e.g., child is normally enrolled for 3 days per week, but is increased to 5 days a week during a week in which a parent is attending a conference).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The program will only cover direct payments for dependent care.  It will not cover other costs associated with professional development activity, including (but not restricted to):&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Travel costs associated with bringing a child to a professional meeting,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per diem for a child at a professional meeting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Faculty should submit the application form prior to travel in order to be sure that the arrangements meet program guidelines and that funds remain in the program for reimbursement.  Funds are limited, and will be provided on a first-come, first-served basis, so early submission of the pre-approval form is encouraged!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the activity has occurred, faculty should submit a reimbursement form (which will be provided once your application has been approved) along with original receipts.  A receipt that clearly indicates the dates of service and the amount of the payment &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;must&lt;/span&gt; accompany all requests for reimbursement.  In the case of non-professional child care (e.g., a high school student who is providing babysitting services), a handwritten receipt will suffice, but it must contain the &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt; of the provider, the provider’s &lt;em&gt;social security number&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;dates&lt;/em&gt; of service, and the &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; received in payment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reimbursements to the faculty member will be reported as taxable income.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/482470/original/dependentcare_form.doc&quot;&gt;application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt; rev. 8/1/16&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
