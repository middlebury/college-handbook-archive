 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Students may be admitted for undergraduate courses at Middlebury only if they do not already have a baccalaureate degree from Middlebury or any other institution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Good Academic Standing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students are &quot;in good academic standing&quot; if they are meeting the requirements of the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy. Seniors who need only one or two courses to graduate and who have been approved for special student status are also considered to be &quot;in good academic standing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Successful completion of a year&quot; for veterans&#039; benefits certification is defined as &quot;in good standing.&quot; Students taking fewer than four courses, however, should consult with the registrar regarding veterans&#039; benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Course Warnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faculty members may send out course warnings to students thought to be in danger of receiving grades of &quot;D&quot; or &quot;F.&quot;  The Commons dean will normally monitor grades around the middle of the term and may contact parents or guardians of students who appear to be having academic difficulties, including receiving one or more course warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Probation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/grades-transcripts&quot;&gt;Grades and Transcripts&lt;/a&gt;. A student who receives two D grades or one failing grade and a D grade in a single semester will be placed on probation until the end of the following fall or spring semester. A student completing a semester with three units of credit who receives one D or one F will be placed on probation. A student who receives a D or an F in the winter term will be placed on probation for the spring semester. A student who receives a D or an F in summer study will be placed on probation for the fall semester. Students placed on probation more than twice in their College careers will be required to withdraw. A student readmitted after an academic failure is readmitted on probation for the following fall or spring semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Off-Campus Study &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student may be granted Off-Campus Study status to pursue a full-time program of studies at another recognized and accredited college or university in the United States or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. Off-Campus Study status for overseas programs is approved by the &lt;a href=&quot;/international/sa&quot;&gt;Off-Campus Study&lt;/a&gt; (Programs Abroad) Committee at the request of the student and the recommendation of his or her major department. Course programs must be approved by the appropriate Middlebury departments in advance to remain in good standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;b. Middlebury agrees to accept approved junior year abroad programs as equivalent to a full year&#039;s work. Students on other forms of leave have no such guarantee and must seek final approval of courses after their return to Middlebury. Students on Off-Campus Study status must inform the College if they withdraw from the institution they are attending or if they take a reduced course load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;c.The following policies will govern readmission for students who have been approved for programs of Off-Campus Study and then wish to change their status:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i. Such students will be readmitted for fall or spring semester only. They will not be readmitted for summer study or for winter term, regardless of the plan for housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ii. The deadline for guaranteed readmission for the fall semester is June 15. After this date, students who wish to be readmitted will be placed on a waiting list. Students on the waiting list will be notified on September 1 if they have been readmitted for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iii. The deadline for guaranteed readmission for the spring semester is November 1. After this date, students who wish to be readmitted will be placed on a waiting list. Students on the waiting list will be notified on January 15 if they have been readmitted for the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iv. There will be no readmissions after the September 1 and January 15 dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Leaves of Absence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;a. Voluntary Leaves of Absence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i. Students may choose to take a leave of absence during their time at Middlebury.  They may choose not to return after a successfully completed semester, or they may choose to take a leave during a semester in progress. If they choose to withdraw from a semester in progress prior to December 1 for the fall semester or May 1 for the spring semester, no courses will appear on their transcript. (A course with a failing grade assessed as a penalty for academic dishonesty by the Academic Judicial Board will not be removed from a transcript regardless of the timing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ii.  Students who withdraw in the middle of a semester are ordinarily eligible for readmission after a full semester away.  If they withdraw from a semester after December 1 (fall) or May 1 (spring), their courses will remain on the transcript. Students who withdraw during winter term or summer study will receive a grade of F for that that term. Any student wishing to take a leave of absence should consult with his or her Commons dean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iii.  Leaves of absence when there is a pending disciplinary matter are addressed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/a.-introductory-matters&quot;&gt;Section B.2.a.iv. Pending Discipline&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iv.  Repeated or Extended Leaves:  A student who has taken three leaves from Middlebury, including any withdrawal for academic failure or mandatory leave of absence, or who has taken a leave of absence in excess of three years, may no longer be eligible for the regular re-admission process. A student in these circumstances who wishes to return to Middlebury should petition for re-enrollment by the Administration Committee.  The more extensive process of a petition for re-enrollment asks the student to document in some detail their readiness to return to Middlebury’s rigorous academic environment, including, as appropriate, how the student’s situation has changed or developed, to support a successful return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;b.  Mandatory Leave of Absence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i. Middlebury College provides a range of support services to address the medical needs of students, including mental health needs, within the context of the campus community. On occasion, students may experience health needs requiring a level of care that exceeds what the College can appropriately provide. In such circumstances, students may take a voluntary leave of absence. In situations where a student is unable or unwilling to carry out substantial self-care obligations, where their behavior is unduly disruptive to the community, where current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence indicates that a student poses a significant risk to the health or safety of others, or where a student poses an actual risk to their own safety not based on mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about individuals with disabilities, and the student does not want to take a leave voluntarily, the Vice President of Student Affairs has the authority to place the student on a mandatory leave of absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ii. Before placing any student on a mandatory leave of absence, Middlebury will do an individualized assessment to determine if there are reasonable accommodations that would permit the student to continue to participate in the campus community without taking a leave of absence.  A medical evaluation by a competent specialist may be required. To enable careful, individualized consideration, the student may need to sign a release authorizing disclosure of relevant information by and between treatment providers working with the student and the appropriate College official(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iii. The student will be notified of the decision to place him or her on leave in writing. Student(s) will be given notice and an opportunity to speak with their Commons dean prior to or within five business days following the start of the mandatory leave.  The decision may be appealed, following the procedures set forth in Section 5.b.iv., below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iv. An appeal of a mandatory leave of absence may be made in writing (including email) to the vice president for Academic Affairs / dean of the faculty (VPAA/DOF) or designee within five business days of receipt of the decision. The appeal must state the grounds for the appeal and include any supporting evidence. The VPAA/DOF will ordinarily notify the student of the appeal decision within ten business days of receipt of the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;v. Students placed on leave under this section may also be subject to the normal disciplinary processes if their conduct has violated College policy. If disciplinary action is appropriate, the matter must be resolved either before or immediately upon the student’s return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;c.  Temporary Medical Leave of Absence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i. A student may request a temporary medical leave of absence for up to ten days. A temporary leave beyond ten days will only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ii. The College may place the student on a temporary mandatory leave of absence for up to ten days when the conditions for a mandatory leave of absence, above, are met.  Whenever possible, the student will be given notice and an opportunity to speak with their Commons dean prior to or within three business days following the start of the temporary leave. The student’s Commons dean, in consultation with others as appropriate, will make a determination as to the student’s request after reviewing the information submitted. There is no right of appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students who are placed on temporary medical leave may also be subject to the normal disciplinary processes when their conduct has violated College policy. If disciplinary action is appropriate, the matter must be resolved either before or immediately upon the student’s return.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students may return from their temporary medical leave after providing documentation and information in accordance with Section 5.d., below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;d. Readmission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i. Students on leave are eligible for readmission for a three-year period, and many students who take a leave will have no requirements attached to their readmission. In some cases, a Dean or the VPSA may impose specific requirements for readmission if the circumstances of the student’s departure warrant it. The goal of such conditions is to prepare the student for a successful return to Middlebury; for example, a student may be asked to complete pre-approved coursework at another institution in order to demonstrate readiness to return to rigorous academic work or to provide clinical information to staff of the Parton Center for Health &amp;amp; Wellness to facilitate a successful return.  For example, student may need to complete the Medical Return Form and respond to any follow-up requests for information from Parton staff.  If the leave is health-related, any conditions or requirements for reinstatement will be based on an individualized assessment of each student including consideration of current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence. Careful consideration will be given to the opinions and recommendations of the student’s treating physician or mental health professional, if available.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As appropriate to the individual circumstances of a student’s departure, a Dean or VPSA may also require that the student provide information to their Commons Dean when they seek readmission.  Typically, this includes a letter about the student&#039;s understanding of the problem that led to the leave, evidence of the student’s work to resolve the issue and/or progress made in managing the issue and other information that may assist the College in evaluating whether the student can safely and effectively participate in the residential academic programs of the College.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ii. Students eligible for readmission can expect to receive instructions for completing the online readmission forms from their Commons dean. They must confirm their plan to return on this readmission date with their Commons dean no later than June 15 for the fall term and November 1 for the spring semester. Students who fail to confirm their plans to return by these deadlines will be placed on a waiting list for readmission. Normally, readmission is for fall or spring semester only. Students will be readmitted for winter term or summer study only with special permission from the Vice President for Student Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iii. Students on probation for disciplinary or academic reasons will resume their probationary status upon their return for the duration of the assigned probationary period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iv. In the rare circumstance that a student’s request for readmission is denied on grounds of health or safety, the decision may be appealed in writing to the Vice President for Student Affairs, or in appropriate, to the VPAA/Dean of the Faculty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodations for Students with Disabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middlebury&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is committed to ensuring equal access to its educational programs for students with disabilities. The term &quot;disability&quot; may include learning, physical, sensory, psychological, medical, and certain temporary disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 as amended, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (504), and anlaoguous state laws prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities and entitle individuals with disabilities to reasonable accommodations. Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations; housing and dining accommodations; modifications to University policies, rules, and regulations; environmental adjustments such as the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers; and auxiliary aids and services. Additional policies and procedures regarding accommodations can be found on the website of Student Accessibility Services and in Middlebury’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/policies-for-all/non-discrim-policies/ada-policy&quot;&gt;Americans with Disabilities Act Policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students with disabilities who seek accommodations must register with Student Accessibility Services. Registration through self-identification is a voluntary process that is treated confidentially and may occur at any time during the student&#039;s course of study. Such students may seek modifications of the academic regulations set forth herein as accommodations from SAS, which may refer certain requests to the &lt;a href=&quot;/student-life/academic-life/Administration-Committee&quot;&gt;Administration Committee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  Withdrawal Due to Academic Failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student who receives two F grades, three D grades, or one F grade and two D grades during a fall or spring semester earns an academic failure and is required to withdraw. Seventh-semester seniors may petition to be reviewed by the Administration Committee prior to final action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student on probation who receives one F grade or two D grades in the subsequent fall or spring semester is required to withdraw. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A student who receives D or an F in the winter term or in summer study while on probation will be required to withdraw. Students placed on probation more than twice in their College career will be required to withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student who is enrolled in three courses and receives one F and one D grade, or two D grades, will be required to withdraw. A student enrolled in three courses who is on probation and who receives one D grade will be required to withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above rules also apply to Middlebury undergraduates who enroll in Language Schools, Schools Abroad, Bread Loaf School of English, School of the Environment, and externally sponsored programs approved by the office of International Programs and Off-Campus Study. Students withdrawn due to academic failure are not eligible to attend any Middlebury school or program until formally readmitted to the College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At any time, a student failing a course, consistently receiving grades below C-, or in any way neglecting the obligations of a course, may be placed on course warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students failing in their studies generally may be withdrawn from the College by the Administration Committee if, in its judgment, failure is due to lack of application or to a negligent attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Readmission After Withdrawal for Academic Failure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A student withdrawn for academic failure will not be readmitted except by special action of the &lt;a href=&quot;/student-life/academic-life/Administration-Committee&quot;&gt;Administration Committee&lt;/a&gt;. Readmission is a special privilege, not a right. The committee will take favorable action only when it is satisfied that the factors which led to failure have been rectified and that the student has both ample motivation and capacity to earn a degree. Mere lapse of time is not a sufficient basis for readmission. The burden of proof of motivation and capacity rests with the student. The student is normally required to enroll full-time at another accredited institution and to achieve a good record there by receiving grades of B- or better in all courses. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/ug-college-policies/ug-policies/academics/x-courses-ocs&quot;&gt;Transfer Courses and Off-Campus Study&lt;/a&gt; for information about the transferability of these courses to Middlebury.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Application for readmission must be made to the &lt;a href=&quot;/student-life/academic-life/Administration-Committee&quot;&gt;Administration Committee&lt;/a&gt;, who will consult with the student&#039;s Commons dean. Application must be made by June 1 for fall semester, and by November 1 for spring semester. Students found to be in academic failure in the spring semester and who request immediate readmission for the following fall must apply by June 15. The Administration Committee may defer action on these applications until an official transcript showing work completed at another institution has been received at Middlebury. Normally, readmission is for fall or spring semester only. Students will be readmitted for winter term or for summer study only with special permission from the Administration Committee in consultation with the student&#039;s Commons dean. Any student readmitted will be on probation for the first semester following return and, if withdrawn a second time, will not be readmitted. A student readmitted on probation for winter term remains on probation for spring semester; a student readmitted on probation for summer study remains on probation for fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;special&quot; id=&quot;special&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Special Students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special student status is designated for students with only one or two remaining courses (although Febs may apply for special student status for the fall semester when they have three remaining courses), and for students with a documented disability for which this arrangement is deemed by the Student Accessibility Services staff to be a reasonable accommodation. Special students are charged by the course, and may not live on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students applying for special student status based on course completion must submit a completed Special Student application to the Office of the Registrar for approval. Students applying for special student status based on a documented disability must submit their request, along with appropriate documentation, to the Student Accessibility Services office. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/academic/records/Forms/stuforms&quot;&gt;Applications for special student status&lt;/a&gt; must ordinarily be filed with the Office of the Registrar by March 15 for the fall semester and November 15 for the spring semester. Students whose circumstances change after March 15 or November 15 may file applications for special student status after those deadlines if they have compelling reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, special students wish to remain living and eating on campus. When this request is based on a documented disability, students should submit this request to the Student Accessibility Services office. When this request is based on exceptional personal circumstances, students may apply to the Administration Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Visiting Students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students from other colleges may be admitted through the Administration Committee, if space is available, for one semester as non-matriculated students. Such students are required to be in good academic and social standing at their home institutions and have the approval of their home institutions. The Administration Committee will review potential visiting students&#039; applications and transcripts and proposed courses of study at Middlebury to ensure that the students meet academic standards and that there is room in the courses they plan to take. Any visiting student wishing to transfer to Middlebury must apply in the regular manner through the Admissions Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Resignation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students who wish to leave Middlebury College and plan never to return may resign from the College. Students who resign must notify the dean of their Commons in writing. There is no readmission after a resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;  Refunds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases of dismissal from the College, no refund of the comprehensive fee is made. In other cases of absence or withdrawal from the College for medical reasons or serious emergencies, fees are refunded according to the &lt;a href=&quot;/offices/support/sfs/sfs-handbook&quot;&gt;College’s refund schedule&lt;/a&gt;. In all cases, the enrollment deposit is forfeited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;em&gt;rev. 9/14/18&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
