All faculty members maintain regular office hours, which are posted on office doors or within department offices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever students experience difficulty in a course, they are encouraged to first seek help from the respective faculty member. Additional support is also available to help students reach their academic goals.at the Center for Teaching, Learning, &amp;amp; Research located in Davis Family Library (extension 3131). CTLR offers the following resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Office of Learning Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning the first week of the semester, on weekdays, the professional staff of Learning Resources are available to meet with students for individual appointments.

Peer writing tutors are also trained to give tips and practical suggestions to assist students with oral presentations. This tutoring is available at the &lt;a href=&quot;/academics/resources/ctlr&quot;&gt;Center for Teaching, Learning, and Research&lt;/a&gt; on the main floor of the Davis Family Library, Suite 225 Sunday through Thursday evenings and some evenings in the Commons and in the Anderson Freeman Center.
