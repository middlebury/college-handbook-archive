 <link>https://www.middlebury.edu/old-about/old-handbook/handbook_archive/handbook-2018-2019/ug-college-policies/ug-policies/res-life-conduct-policies/genl-cond-standards/node/631992</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last updated July 16, 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A. Respect for Persons&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;All students, as members of the Middlebury community, are expected to respect the dignity, freedom, and rights of others. Violence against another; incitement or provocation to violence; negligent or reckless use of physical force; conduct that may reasonably be expected to exploit or coerce; prevention of another&#039;s ability to communicate or move freely; violation of another&#039;s privacy; unauthorized entry and/or uninvited or unwanted presence in another’s room or office, are prohibited.  Behavior that violates common standards of decency, fails to comply with local laws or statutes, or demonstrates contempt for the generally accepted values of the intellectual community is prohibited.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;B. Communicating with Honesty and Integrity&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middlebury’s General Conduct Standards and &lt;a href=&quot;/about/handbook/policies-for-all&quot;&gt;Middlebury-Wide Policies&lt;/a&gt;  include acting with integrity and honesty in all actions and communications relating to Middlebury. Therefore, providing information to any member of the Middlebury staff or faculty that an individual knows or reasonably should know is false or misleading is a serious violation of Middlebury policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Respect for Middlebury’s Educational Function &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any disruption of Middlebury’s educational function is prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect for the Authority of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middlebury &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Officials&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middlebury depends on employees and agents to advance the educational mission of the institution. These employees and agents include but are not limited to faculty members; deans; administrative, custodial, dining, and library staff; Public Safety and Campus Security officers and their equivalents; residential life staff; and other individuals such as members of the police and ambulance forces, service providers, and security staff. All students are expected to respect the authority of these individuals when they are executing their responsibilities for Middlebury.  Students are expected to cooperate fully in the disciplinary process and any student, whether a party or a witness, who refuses to cooperate may be subject to discipline. Failure to comply with requests from Middlebury officials will subject a student to disciplinary sanctions.  Students are expected to identify themselves by showing their Middlebury identification card upon request of Middlebury officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;E. Respect for Middlebury&#039;s Resources and Others’ Property&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middlebury’s educational mission depends on careful stewardship of our shared resources, including campus buildings, land, and other property, and of the property of members of our community. Theft, vandalism and property damage are prohibited. Unauthorized use of services, including dining hall meals and materials, and disposition of property to another under the pretense that it is one&#039;s own are forms of theft.  Sanctions will include restitution or replacement and may also include disciplinary sanctions. When such theft or damage constitutes a criminal offense, it will ordinarily be reported to law enforcement authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
