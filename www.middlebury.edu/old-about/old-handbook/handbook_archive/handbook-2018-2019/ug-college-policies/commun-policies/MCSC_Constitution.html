Name</strong></p><p>The name of this organization is the Middlebury Staff Council (hereinafter referred to as MSC).</p><p><strong>Article II. Purpose</strong></p><p>The purpose of the MSC is to help make Middlebury a great place to work. The MSC is elected by the staff employees, and acknowledged by the Board of Trustees, to establish priorities for the staff. The MSC's responsibilities include, but are not limited to:</p><p><strong>A.</strong> Listen and respond to the ideas, opinions, problems, concerns, and consider other matters;</p><p><strong>B</strong>. Organize data, staff views, and other information into reports, and formulate recommendations for actions, changes, and solutions, as required;</p><p><strong>C.</strong> Convey reports and recommendations to Middlebury’s administration;</p><p><strong>D.</strong> Meet with the Middlebury administration on a regular basis to communicate reports and recommendations;</p><p><strong>Article III. Members, Officers, and Elections</strong></p><p><strong>A. Membership</strong></p><p>Voting membership of the MSC consists of one Middlebury staff employee for each District and At-Large position. A staff member from Human Resources serves as a non-voting member. Voting members of the MSC serve two-year terms, which begin on the first Monday after their election. Expiring terms are refilled by election. Each voting member serves on at least one MSC committee and/or the MSC Executive Committee.</p><p>The Staff Council will be charged with dividing the staff into up to 12 group districts. Thirty days prior to redistricting, staff will be notified of any changes. </p><p>The current assignment of positions to an employee work group or campus district is attached as Appendix A. These assignments can be changed from time to time by the MSC Election Committee subject to the approval of the MSC. Composition of campus districts is monitored by the MSC to assure balanced representation.</p><p>Benefits-eligible employees working in the United States (full-time and part-time) whose primary designation is not faculty, are eligible to participate in MSC meetings, to vote in MSC elections and to serve as elected MSC representatives.<br /><br /><strong>B. Officers</strong></p><p>A president, vice president, and co-secretaries are elected from among the voting members of the MSC by its voting members. Each officer serves for one year and may be reelected. The four officers of the MSC make up the MSC Executive Committee.</p><p><strong>a.</strong> The MSC president presides at meetings of the MSC, prepares the agenda for MSC meetings, and casts a vote in case of a tie vote. In addition, the MSC president is the official representative of the staff and the MSC to the Middlebury president and the Middlebury community at large. The MSC president also serves as the budget administrator for the MSC budget, which is a regular Middlebury budget account. The president may choose to appoint any MSC member to serve as budget administrator. The MSC president serves as an<em> ex officio</em> member of all MSC committees.</p><p><strong>b.</strong> The MSC vice president presides at MSC meetings in the absence of the MSC president, provides general assistance to the MSC president, and serves as the MSC representative to the Community Council.</p><p><strong>c.</strong> The MSC secretaries share responsibility for the secretarial duties of the MSC. Those duties include but are not limited to: taking minutes of each MSC meeting and distributing these minutes to all MSC members and to appropriate locations on campus; informing MSC members and staff employees of the date, time, location, and agenda of MSC meetings; maintaining the records of the MSC. Allocation of secretarial duties is determined by the secretaries and the MSC.</p><p>The MSC meets annually with the senior representative from Human Resources and the senior financial officer or their designee to review general guidelines and practices for staff salaries and benefits for the purpose of recommending improvements in these areas. The MSC meets periodically with representatives of the Board of Trustees and with the Middlebury president to communicate staff issues.</p><p>When necessary, the MSC Executive Committee may reassign duties among the executive officers. In the event that a member of the MSC Executive Committee is unable to attend a meeting, another member of the MSC may be appointed by the MSC president to serve at that meeting. If a member of the Executive Committee resigns or is unable to continue in office, MSC representatives will elect a new officer to complete the unexpired term.<br /><br /><strong>C. Elections</strong></p><p>MSC elections are held annually in May.</p><p>The MSC Election Committee, under the direction of the MSC, develops election procedures, establishes election deadlines, recruits candidates, and conducts nominations and elections for MSC representatives, validates the results, and resolves any problems that arise from the election process.</p><p>All voting is by secret ballot.</p><p><strong>Nomination Procedure</strong></p><p><strong>a.</strong> Four weeks before the final election date, election procedures, including deadlines and nomination forms, are sent to all staff employees whose representatives are up for election.</p><p><strong>b.</strong> The nomination forms for representatives of specific employee work groups or campus districts list the names of all eligible employees in that group or district and are distributed to members of that group or district only.</p><p><strong>c.</strong> Staff employees may nominate one person from their specific employee work group or campus district.</p><p><strong>d.</strong> In the case of the member-at-large, the nomination form provides space for one write-in candidate. A list of all staff employees eligible for nomination will be distributed. Nominations must be made from that list.</p><p><strong>e.</strong> Nomination by official ballot takes place at least three weeks before the date of the final election.</p><p>f. A nominee may decline to run for office.</p><p><strong>Election Procedure</strong></p><p><strong>a.</strong> At least two weeks in advance of the final election date, the Election Committee sends out ballots to voting staff employees.</p><p><strong>b.</strong> The staff employees who received the most nominations and agree<span>d</span> to run are listed on the ballot for each vacant representative's seat.<span> </span>In any given election, the Election Committee, with the approval of the MSC, may choose to limit the number of nominees who will be listed on the election ballot (although the same limitation will apply to all positions in a given year). The ballots also contain space for write-in candidates.</p><p><strong>c.</strong> Staff employees may vote once within their employee work group or campus district and once for the member-at-large representative.</p><p><strong>d.</strong> The candidate who receives the most votes for each vacant representative's seat in which they are eligible to serve is elected to the MSC. In case of a tie, a run-off election will be held within a month between the highest vote-getters to determine a winner.</p><p>If an MSC representative resigns or is unable to continue in office, another staff employee from the representative's employee group or campus district will be appointed by the MSC to serve. The remainder of that unexpired term. In the case of an at-large member, the appointment will be made from among all eligible staff members.</p><p>An MSC representative may serve three consecutive terms, with a hiatus of two years before running again.</p><p><strong>Recall Procedure</strong></p><p>An MSC representative may be recalled from office by the following procedure:</p><p><strong>a.</strong> A recall may be initiated by the staff employees in the employee work group or district that the MSC member represents, provided that a recall petition is signed by one-third of the staff employees in that group or district. In the case of the member-at-large, a petition must be signed by 100 eligible staff employees.</p><p><strong>b.</strong> Upon receipt of the petition, the MSC will conduct a recall vote within 30 days.</p><p><strong>c.</strong> The recall vote will be taken among the staff employees represented by the MSC member for whom the recall has been petitioned.</p><p><strong>d.</strong> A simple majority of those voting in favor of a recall is required for the recall to take effect.
