 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The use and possession of weapons are prohibited on Middlebury property and at Middlebury sponsored events, including in motor vehicles. Antique, imitation, and replicas of weapons are also prohibited unless they are possessed or stored in accordance to the Exceptions section below. Discovery of a weapon on Middlebury property or carried by a person (openly or concealed) on Middlebury property, or at Middlebury sponsored events, or any other violation of the weapons policy, shall result in confiscation of the weapon. Disciplinary action against the owner and/or person in possession may be taken, which may include but not be limited to removal from Middlebury property, arrest, expulsion, suspension, probation, discipline, dismissal or termination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This policy applies to all faculty, staff, students, employees, and visitors at all Middlebury property, including those who have a valid permit to carry a concealed weapon. This policy shall not apply to a law enforcement officer while engaged in law enforcement duties, or an active duty member of the armed forces. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Definitions of key terms are provided below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matriculated students and students enrolled in a Middlebury program and living on a Vermont campus are permitted, in accordance with Vermont law, to possess weapons for hunting and sporting related activities only, such as target practice.  Assault weapons and semi-automatic weapons with rapid-fire capability are expressly prohibited.  A handgun is only allowed to be on campus if it is a duty weapon issued or authorized by the student-owner’s employer.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;All permitted weapons must be registered with and stored at the Department of Public Safety located at 125 South Main Street, Middlebury, Vermont. Requirements for storage in Vermont can be found on the Department of Public Safety website.  The Institute of International Studies at Monterey does not allow or provide for weapons storage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Due to their realistic likeness to weapons and potential for causing community alarm, possession or use of toy or replica weapons in a Middlebury-sanctioned activity or academic program must be approved in advance by the Director of Public Safety in Middlebury, or Campus Security in Monterey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Explosive” is defined as any material, liquid, or substance that causes a sudden, instantaneous release of air, pressure, gas, and heat, including bombs, grenades, rockets and fireworks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Firearm” is defined as any weapon, whether loaded or unloaded, which will expel a projectile by the action of an explosive such as but not limited to a pistol, revolver, handgun, rifle (bolt action, lever action, pump action, semi-automatic, and single-shot), gun, machine gun or shotgun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Knife” is defined as a blade six inches or longer in length or with blades less than six inches that, by design, can be used as weapons, such as switchblades or double-edged blades.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Middlebury property” is defined as any property, facility, or grounds owned, leased, controlled or subcontracted by Middlebury. This includes the campuses of Middlebury College, Bread Loaf, and the Institute of International Studies at Monterey, as well as the Middlebury C.V. Starr Schools Abroad. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Weapon” is defined as any firearm, explosive, knife, sword, club, bow or other object that has been designed with the intent to inflict bodily harm or physical damage to property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
